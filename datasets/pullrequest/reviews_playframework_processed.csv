Rather than making a pull request, I wanted to discuss my findings here first, because I don't know how well they will be received.\n\nSuppose we have: \n\n```\ncase class Foo(id: Long, value: Either[String, Foo])\n```\n\nand some:\n\n```\nimplicit def eitherReads[A : Reads, B : Reads]: Reads[Either[A, B]] = ???\n```\n\nThe following macro call will fail from a type-mismatch error:\n\n```\nimplicit val reads = Json.reads[Foo]\n```\n\nAfter some digging, I found that if the macro determines that the structure is recursive (and not using a nullable call), it will eventually land [here](https://github.com/playframework/playframework/blob/f7e17a7880972b2e6a955e71a7035ae0f7903681/framework/src/play-json/src/main/scala/play/api/libs/json/JsMacroImpl.scala#L192-L200). This means that even if the [implicit found earlier in the macro](https://github.com/playframework/playframework/blob/f7e17a7880972b2e6a955e71a7035ae0f7903681/framework/src/play-json/src/main/scala/play/api/libs/json/JsMacroImpl.scala#L151) has type `Reads[Either[String, Foo]]`, the macro will insert the recursive call of type `Reads[Foo]` in the [`else` branch](https://github.com/playframework/playframework/blob/f7e17a7880972b2e6a955e71a7035ae0f7903681/framework/src/play-json/src/main/scala/play/api/libs/json/JsMacroImpl.scala#L200).\n\nOne idea I had was inspecting the implicit tree that was resolved, and carefully splicing in the call to `this.lazyStuff`. I see only a few possibilities for the structure of the implicit tree:\n1.  An implicit method that likely has it's own implicit parameters, to handle generics. Such as `Reads.seq`, or the above `eitherReads`, etc.\n2.  An implicit that can be typechecked to `N[A]` (an exact recursive call to the ident the macro result will be assigned to).\n3.  Some other static tree, such as an implicit val, or object, which requires no recursion and can be left alone.\n\nSo I wrote a method to handle these cases:\n\n```\ndef recursiveReplace(impl: Tree): List[Tree] = impl match {\n  case q""$obj.$impldef[..$tparams](..$implparams)"" => {\n    val replaced = implparams.map(p => recursiveReplace(p))\n    q""$obj.$impldef[..$tparams](..$replaced)""\n  }\n  case obj if (c.typecheck(obj).tpe <:< natag.tpe) => q""this.lazyStuff""\n  case tree => tree\n}\n```\n\nThis will inspect a implicitly resolved tree and attempt to more carefully splice in the recursive calls. If the tree is a (1), it will extract the parameter trees and process them recursively with `recursiveReplace`. If it is a (2), it is replaced with the recursive call to the macro result `q""this.lazyStuff""`. If it is a (3) (for the moment), the tree is left alone.\n\nI wrote a few tests for `Either` and replaced [this call](https://github.com/playframework/playframework/blob/f7e17a7880972b2e6a955e71a7035ae0f7903681/framework/src/play-json/src/main/scala/play/api/libs/json/JsMacroImpl.scala#L200) with a call to `recursiveReplace(impl)`. Theoretically, `recursiveReplace` should also work for the manually handled `Set`, `List`, `Map` and `Seq` helpers, so I tried removing them and the tests failed (rather, didn't compile). It was then I realized the fix wouldn't work without a type annotation on the macro result, and why the aforementioned types are being handled specially.\n\nOne [already existing test](https://github.com/playframework/playframework/blob/f7e17a7880972b2e6a955e71a7035ae0f7903681/framework/src/play-json/src/test/scala/play/api/libs/json/JsonExtensionSpec.scala#L416-L426) for example contains:\n\n```\nimplicit val userReads = Json.reads[UserMap]\n```\n\nWhere `UserMap` is: `case class UserMap(name: String, friends: Map[String, UserMap] = Map())`\n\nIt _would_ work with my patch if the test actually read: \n\n```\nimplicit val userReads: Reads[UserMap] = Json.reads[UserMap]\n```\n\nThe problem lies in the implicit resolution. The type checker fails to find the implicit `Reads[Map[...]]` because it can't find the `Reads[UserMap]` that it depends on, because there is no type annotation:\n\n```\n/playframework/framework/src/play-json/src/test/scala/play/api/libs/json/JsonExtensionSpec.scala:465: json.this.Reads.mapReads is not a valid implicit value for play.api.libs.json.Reads[Map[String,play.api.libs.json.UserMap]] because:\n[info] hasMatchingSymbol reported error: No Json deserializer found for type play.api.libs.json.UserMap. Try to implement an implicit Reads or Format for this type.\n[info]       implicit val userReads = Json.reads[UserMap]\n```\n\nSo the ""needed implicit"" is actually an empty tree.\n\nIt seems like the macro can be much more powerful than it currently is, to support any kind of recursive type (well, maybe not any, but many more). The obvious problem with the above solution is that it introduces a breaking change where client code must annotate `Reads`, `Writes` and `Format` generated by the macro (at least in the recursive case).\n\nHowever:\n- It is very rigid to only support `Set`, `List`, `Map` and `Seq`, and `Option` within recursive types, and adding more would make the code far more ugly.\n- Isn't it good practice to explicitly annotate implicit result types anyway?\n- Many user-defined recursive types are not supported by the macro because of this.\n\nOr is needing to annotate the macro result unacceptable?\n",closed,false,2016-09-06T17:57:02.000Z,2016-09-14T21:19:30.000Z,2016-09-14T20:50:27.000Z,true,,8,2,24,1,699,295,11,0,,1," LGTM\n",0,,0,,0,,1," lgtm\n",0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,

I made a small suggestion which I think would help, as well as make it easier to customize supported encodings.\n\nI hope it's clear how defining a list of encodings would greatly simplify the logic here. If not let me know where I can explain more.\n",0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,1," ",0,,0,,0,,10,"          ",0,,0,,0,,3,"   ",0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,

A `MessagesApi` reference\r\n2. A `Lang` reference\r\n3. The key / value to actually call the message.\r\n\r\n```\r\nval message = messagesApi.apply(key)(implicit lang)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere is a case class `Messages`, which locks down the `Lang` reference, and lets you call just one thing:\r\n\r\n```\r\nval message = messages.apply(key)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut there's a problem in that `Messages` is a concrete case class, which doesn't just expose `apply` like it should.  It also exposes messagesApi (not great) and extends Product (which means `copy` et al) and it means that delegating / mocking out those methods is basically impossible.  \r\n\r\nThis gets even worse when you look at the form helpers signature:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@(field: play.api.data.Field, args: (Symbol,Any)*)(implicit handler: FieldConstructor, messages: play.api.i18n.Messages)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause all the form helpers require the `Messages` case class to be passed in to the template, that means that for any template with a form helper, there must be an implicit Messages in scope.  This means we have to specify an implicit messages in template:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@(form: Form[UserData])(implicit m: Messages)\r\n\r\n@main(""Welcome to Play"") {\r\n  @helper.inputText(form(""name""))\r\n  @helper.inputText(form(""age""))\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo if you declare a form:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass HomeController @Inject() extends Controller {\r\n  import play.api.data.Forms._\r\n  import play.api.data._\r\n\r\n  val form = Form(\r\n    mapping = mapping(\r\n      ""name"" -> text,\r\n      ""age"" -> number\r\n    )(UserData.apply)(UserData.unapply)\r\n  )\r\n\r\n  def index = Action {\r\n    Ok(views.html.index(form))\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNope: ""could not find implicit value for parameter m: play.api.i18n.Messages"".  Using `(implicit r: Request[_])` doesn't work either, because you don't have a reference to `MessagesApi` from the request.  (Ironically, you can get one from a Java template, because Http.Context will provide one implicitly, but we're talking about Scala.)\r\n\r\nThe canonical way to do it is to use I18NSupport:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass HomeController @Inject()\r\n  (val messagesApi: play.api.i18n.MessagesApi) \r\n  extends Controller with play.api.i18n.I18nSupport {\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt which point the implicit conversion of request2Messages will kick in, and `@(form: Form[UserData])(implicit m: Messages)` will work.  \r\n\r\nBut we're not done yet.  We want to use CSRF in the form,  \r\n\r\n```\r\n@helper.CSRF.formField\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut when we try this, we get `Cannot find any HTTP Request Header here`.\r\n\r\n which means we have to include the request implicitly as well:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@(form: Form[UserData])(implicit request: RequestHeader, m: Messages)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich means for a basic ""hello world"" type form, we have to implement and / or inject `MessagesApi`, `I18nSupport`, `Request[_]` and `Messages` into the controller and template.  \r\n\r\nWhat this PR does instead is:\r\n- Provide Messages functionality through a `Messager` interface (""Messenger"" was considered too confusing)\r\n- Create a `MessagerProvider` interface with a single `messager: Messager` interface.\r\n- Make `Messages` extends `Messager` and `MessageProvider` so existing code will continue to work\r\n- Make the form helpers take `MessagerProvider` instead of `Messages`.\r\n\r\nUsing a MessagerProvider means that we can break out the messagesApi from the controller, and move it into the request or the action:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntrait MessagesRequestHeader extends RequestHeader with MessagerProvider\r\n\r\nabstract class MessagesRequest[A](request: Request[A])\r\n  extends WrappedRequest(request) with MessagesRequestHeader\r\n\r\nclass MessagesAction @Inject()(messagesApi: MessagesApi) extends ActionBuilder[MessagesRequest] {\r\n  override def invokeBlock[A](request: Request[A], block: (MessagesRequest[A]) => Future[Result]) = {\r\n    block(new MessagesRequest[A](request) {\r\n      lazy val messager: Messager = messagesApi.preferred(request)\r\n    })\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich means the following is all that's required in the controller:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass HomeController @Inject() (action: MessagesAction) extends Controller {\r\n  def index = action { implicit request =>\r\n    Ok(views.html.index(form))\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd this is all that's needed in the template:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@()(implicit mr: MessagesRequestHeader)\r\n```\r\n\r\nTechnically this could be `MessagesProvider`, but it's not great that something that is essentially a partially applied function on `messages.get(lang)(key)` is being exposed as a case class.  Everything still returns `Messages`, so it's only classes that take `Messages` as input that should switch to `Messager`.\r\n",closed,false,2016-08-14T23:44:31.000Z,2017-04-21T19:54:51.000Z,2016-10-28T03:02:14.000Z,true,,6,6,17,2,1189,593,45,0,,0,,0,,0,,2,"  ",1," ",0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,2,"  ",0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,1," ",0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,

In particular, see what you can do with the [Logstash Logback Encoder](https://github.com/logstash/logstash-logback-encoder#event-specific-custom-fields):\n\n``` scala\nimplicit def requestToMarkerContext[A](request: Request[A]): MarkerContext = {\n  import net.logstash.logback.marker.LogstashMarker\n  import net.logstash.logback.marker.Markers._\n\n  val requestMarkers: LogstashMarker = append(""host"", request.host)\n    .and(append(""path"", request.path))\n\n  MarkerContext(requestMarkers)\n}\n\ndef index = Action { request =>  \n  logger.debug(""index: "")(request)\n  Ok(""testing"")\n}\n```\n## Background Context\n\nFirst, because play.api.Logger does not take Marker, at all, so it should be added.  There's a number of teams that use SLF4J because the underlying API is richer.  The static API for play.Logger / play.api.Logger is a distinct issue and is not being touched here.\n\nSecond, By using an implicit context, one of the main problems with logging contextual information can be resolved without using MDC / thread locals.  \n\nThirdly, if we can't get rid of the Logger API, we should make it useful.  This should help with things like [logstash-logback-encoder](https://github.com/logstash/logstash-logback-encoder), for example, although it doesn't touch StructuredArguments:\n\n```\nlogger.info(""My Message {}"", StructuredArguments.keyValue(""key"", ""value""))\n```\n## References\n\nDeprecate Play Logger (note does not deal with Scala Logger): https://github.com/playframework/playframework/issues/1669\n",closed,false,2016-07-19T19:32:31.000Z,2016-10-25T19:57:19.000Z,2016-10-25T17:46:03.000Z,true,,5,1,7,1,604,37,6,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,1," ",0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,

Before this change these properties were\r\ndefined as lazy values on the RequestHeader trait.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the lazy values needed to access global state to get\r\ntheir configuration and it was difficult to feed into the\r\nRequestHeader trait without adding configuration as a property of the\r\nRequestHeader object itself.\r\n\r\nThis commit changes the RequestHeader trait so that it stores the\r\ncookie, session and flash objects as attributes of the RequestHeader\r\nin a TypedMap instead of as lazy properties.\r\n\r\nThe attributes are explicitly attached to the RequestHeader using a\r\nnew type of class called a RequestFactory. The RequestFactory is used\r\nto create every RequestHeader that is sent to an application.\r\n\r\nThe RequestFactory participates in dependency injection, so it doesn't\r\nuse any global state to do its work. It manipulates the cookie,\r\nsession and flash objects based on its injected configuration.\r\n\r\nIn order to make it easier to create, transform and manipulate\r\nrequests I simplified their properties a bit more. I made two new\r\nobjects to bundle together sets of related request properties. The\r\nRequestTarget class holds the URI, path and query string. The\r\nRemoteConnection class holds the remote address, HTTPS and certificate\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nI considered using a filter to attach the attributes to the request.\r\nHowever a filter doesn't work with only a RequestHeader; it expects a\r\nRequest with a body. Also filters are asynchronous; a simple\r\nsynchronous function for creating RequestHeaders is usually more\r\nconvenient.\r\n\r\nSince I was already moving the cookies, session and flash properties\r\ninto attributes, I did the same for the request id and request tags.\r\n\r\nThings to consider in the future:\r\n\r\n1. Moving the ForwardedHeaderHandler logic out of the ModelConversion\r\n   classes and into the default RequestFactory.\r\n2. Making the RequestFactory implementation configurable so that\r\n   users can make their own kinds of requests.\r\n3.

The default behavior is not changed, unallowed origins are forbidden. Please note that serving forbidden origins as non-CORS requests doesn't lower the security, given that browsers check the access control headers and block the response anyway.\n## Background Context\n\nNot all requests with an `Origin` header are CORS requests generated by browsers. Other clients can set the `Origin` header, don't send preflight calls, and don't expect to receive CORS access control headers in the answer. A common client of such type is a Cordova application, that always sends the `Origin: file://` header.\n",closed,false,2016-09-20T18:02:18.000Z,2017-05-11T17:06:07.000Z,2016-11-08T04:51:24.000Z,true,,8,1,0,1,42,4,6,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,1," LGTM\n",0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,

The essential logic of ""remove on GC"" hasn't changed.\r\n\r\nI think fixing https://github.com/playframework/playframework/issues/5545 means doing something with TemporaryFile that meet the criteria on a scheduled basis, using an Akka actor and scheduler to delete wayward files.  Probably more robust than finalization solution anyway...\r\n\r\n## Background Context\r\n\r\nThere are a few cases that should be addressed here, as TemporaryFile is used internally for maxFileBuffer stuff and so may not be accessible to the client.\r\n\r\nCase 1: The application calls `tempFileCreator.delete(temporaryFile)`.  In this case, the removal is explicit.\r\n\r\nCase 2: There is a call to move the temporary file to another location, using `temporaryFile.moveTo`.  In this case, the file should no longer exist in the old place, but the tempFileCreator didn't remove it.\r\n\r\nCase 3: The TemporaryFile goes out of scope, and at some point GC kicks in and removes the temporary file.  This is possible because there are custom form handling cases using TemporaryFile from user code, and so it could be that it's created, read, but never explicitly deleted.  Here, there is an edge case https://github.com/playframework/playframework/issues/5545 where if the TemporaryFile goes out of scope but for whatever reason a GC does not kick in fast enough, then there can be a gross accumulation of file in the tempfilesystem space.\r\n\r\nNote that this is not the same thing as https://github.com/playframework/playframework/issues/4707 -- in the event of JVM crash / application start, all the temp files are cleaned up when the application comes back online -- but if the temp fs is full, then that poses its own problems.\r\n\r\nCase 3 / https://github.com/playframework/playframework/issues/5545 is addressed by the reaper, which is disabled by default, but which can delete files older than a given date and runs using the akka scheduler.\r\n\r\nAlso see [Potential delete of temporary file before it is used](https://github.com/playframework/playframework/issues/6786)\r\n\r\n",closed,false,2016-11-28T00:32:16.000Z,2017-02-16T18:25:38.000Z,2016-12-09T06:42:50.000Z,true,,0,11,11,2,915,305,34,0,,0,,0,,0,,4,"    ",1," lgtm",1," ",0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,4,"    ",0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,1," ",0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,

The em doesn't get stored in a `ThreadLocal` anymore.\r\n\r\nOnly when using `@Transactional` the entity manager still will be stored in the `Http.Context` so we can access and (re-)use it later from within the controller's action methods. But I did change how this happens. Instead of just accessing `Http.Context.current()` you now have to explicitly pass the `context` in which the em should get stored to `withTransaction` (happens in `TransactionalAction.java`).\r\nEventually, to retrieve the em we now have to pass a context to `JPA.em(ctx)`.\r\n\r\nWith this changes `JPAEntityManagerContext` is becoming ""just"" a simple helper class which just makes it easier to store and read entity managers from a http context.\r\n\r\nIn future we can remove `JPA.em()` (it's deprecated now) in favor of `JPA.em(ctx)` - actually it's just a shortcut for `JPAEntityManagerContext.em(ctx)`.\r\n\r\nThis should make `play-jpa` ready for the removal of the http context threadlocal which I think is targeted for a future play version. (It should work nicely with the changes in #6473 done by @gmethvin)\r\n\r\nOne more thing:\r\nIn `@TransactionalAction` we tell `withTransaction` to keep the em and transaction open so it doesn't get closed immediately but only after the future has completed. I am not entirely sure if this should be managed here or if I should add a `withTransaction` that returns a `CompletionStage<T>` and manage it there.

My idea is to separate the responsibility of get the `EntityManager` and the execution of transactions completely so that the `JPAApi` won't be responsible to expose/create/retrieve `EntityManager`s.\r\n\r\nThe complete surface of `JPAApi` would be:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic interface JPAApi {\r\n\r\n    public <T> T withTransaction(Function<EntityManager, T> block);\r\n\r\n    public <T> T withTransaction(String name, Function<EntityManager, T> block);\r\n\r\n    public <T> T withTransaction(String name, boolean readOnly, Function<EntityManager, T> block);\r\n\r\n    public <T> T withTransaction(Supplier<T> block);\r\n\r\n    public void withTransaction(Runnable block);\r\n\r\n    public <T> T withTransaction(String name, boolean readOnly, Supplier<T> block);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then, we can inject a `EntityManager` resolver into the `DefaultJPAApi`. This resolver could use the `Http.Context` right now, but it will eventually migrate to use #6798. The way I see #6798 evolving, we can even have controllers like this:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic MyController extends Controller {\r\n\r\n    private EntityManager em;\r\n\r\n    @Inject\r\n    public MyController(EntityManager em) {\r\n        this.em = em;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnyway, we are not there yet.

See the [docs](https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/validator/5.2/reference/en-US/html_single/#validator-gettingstarted-uel):\r\n> Hibernate Validator requires an implementation of the Unified Expression Language (JSR 341) for evaluating dynamic expressions **in constraint violation messages**\r\n\r\nSo you *could* [use expressions like](https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/validator/5.2/reference/en-US/html_single/#_examples) `${validatedValue}` and `${formatter.format('%1$.2f', validatedValue)}` or [reference the attribute values of the constraint](https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/validator/5.2/reference/en-US/html_single/#section-interpolation-with-message-expressions).\r\n\r\nSo for this message interpolation we did include the `javax.el` dependency: Otherwise we would get `ClassNotFoundExceptions` as soon a Play app (containing constraints) starts up - even when we never ever use these interpolation feature(s). **And that's the point:**\r\nAs it turns out Play cooks it's own soup on how to handle constraint error messages. Play's concept completely bypasses the way Hibernate validator retrieves error messages. Play uses the constraint message only to ""transport"" message keys of it's `conf/messages` file. What happens is that after a form got validated, Play builds it's own `ValidationError` objects containing the message key (and it's arguments) which it [retrieved (interpolated already) from Hibernate validator](https://github.com/playframework/playframework/blob/2.5.10/framework/src/play-java/src/main/java/play/data/Form.java#L320) and uses these objects for further processing ([rendering the error messages (by looking up in the `conf/messages`)](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.5.x/JavaForms#handling-binding-failure), etc.).\r\n\r\nGiving this, I don't see the need for interpolation these constraint messages (keys) before passing it to Play. [By providing](https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/validator/5.2/reference/en-US/html_single/#section-validator-factory-message-interpolator) Hibernate Validator our own simple custom `MessageInterpolater` you see in this PR, we can just pass the message keys through. (May also improve performance).\r\n\r\nSure, someone could just write plain error messages into constraint's `message` attributes (instead of message keys) and *may* want to interpolate them the Hibernate validator way, but I think this is not what Play enforces you to do (giving all the documention is based on the message key concept - plus think of the `ValidationError` object concept).

Firefox itself, since version 47 I think, does not work with Selenium and now you have to use [GeckoDriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver). The whole situation is kind of volatile:\r\n\r\n> Mozilla has been a front-runner in implementing the W3C WebDriver protocol. On the plus side, this has exposed problems with the spec as it has evolved, but it also means that Firefox support is hard to track as their engineering efforts have been forward looking, rather than on supporting the current wire protocol used by Selenium WebDriver. For now, the best advice we can offer is for you to try the latest release of geckodriver and Selenium together. - [Selenium 3.0 release announcement](https://seleniumhq.wordpress.com/2016/10/13/selenium-3-0-out-now/)\r\n\r\nRight now, this is something that is not well resolved at scalatestplus-play (my bad), at least not related to travis build setup.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nIn other words, we should add some information about this update at our migration guide (Migration26.md) and point users to relevant documentation regarding Selenium3 + Firefox.",0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,2,"  ",0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,

It is being used by most of the controllers and the actual solution is to migrate away from play.api.mvc.Controller and use play.api.mvc.AbstractController, which is more verbose. That means that user code, in order to avoid deprecation warnings, have to be rewritten from:\r\n\r\n    class MyController extends Controller\r\n\r\nto:\r\n\r\n    class MyController(components: ControllerComponents) extends AbstractController(components)\r\n\r\nThis PR uses Guice field injection to maintain the former syntax while partially avoiding global state. The drawbacks here are:\r\n\r\n1. Mixing constructor and field injection, which could be unclear\r\n2.

Would that be possible in this case? Also it seems like this wouldn't support languages with scripts like `zh-Hans`.\r\n\r\nSince the language tag is a standard using that would make this default format more interoperable. If we really wanted to have a complete object representation of a locale, we need the language, country, variant and script codes. In addition, locales can define extensions, for example `de-DE-u-co-phonebk` would mean German with phonebook collation.\r\n\r\nThe extensions could be parsed out and represented as a map but I don't know if it would be particularly useful. If we don't do that, the `OWrites` representation is actually less accurate than the language tag. Is there a particular use case you're thinking of for the JSON object?

SHA1 HMAC is not implicated, but the trend is inexorable http://valerieaurora.org/hash.html and with 2.6.x coming out, it's a good time to change the default.  Blake2b is faster than SHA-1 https://blake2.net/ and is perfectly suited for MAC.\r\n\r\nThis should not affect most projects, but it is possible that projects which poke into the session handling cookie may break.  \r\n\r\nThere may be a problem with rolling upgrades, because session cookies will not validate as users roll between servers.  Maybe it'd be better to have fallback behavior, but that would be something you'd only want during the rollover.\r\n\r\nThe old behavior is still available if projects need it, by setting `play.http.secret.mac=HmacSHA1` in application.conf.\r\n\r\nWIP: Needs notes in Migration26.md, possibly add this to Highlights26.md",closed,false,2017-02-23T21:05:42.000Z,2017-03-14T21:11:54.000Z,2017-03-14T21:11:24.000Z,false,false,1,6,6,5,93,46,11,0,,0,,0,,0,,1," ",0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,1," ",0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,2,"  ",0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,2,"  ",0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,

A `Map` entry's key will always be the same as the keys of the `ValidationError`s the `Map` entry stores anyway. It seemed the only ""sense"" to store the `ValidationError`s in a map was to access it ""more easy"" via `.get(""somekey"")` - but since we are using Java >= 8 we can simple use stream methods (`filter`, `findFirst` , etc.) to access the desired error(s).\r\n\r\nAlso it turns out the use of a `Map` here is a leftover from one of Play 2 first commits ever - where a `ValidationError` [didn't have a `key` field yet](https://github.com/playframework/playframework/commit/8d644fe0f629bb5213f0dbcd393d419329fba664#diff-5ca281da229236db4cc36a9058ce1238) (so using a map back than seems reasonable).\r\n\r\nPlus: The Scala `Form` uses [a simple `List`](https://github.com/playframework/playframework/blob/2.6.0-M1/framework/src/play/src/main/scala/play/api/data/Form.scala#L35) as well - so we just bring [the Java implemention on par with it](https://github.com/playframework/playframework/blob/2.6.0-M1/framework/src/play/src/main/scala/play/api/data/Form.scala#L174).",closed,false,2017-02-17T12:06:03.000Z,2017-03-03T22:15:04.000Z,2017-03-03T22:14:21.000Z,true,,8,20,22,17,274,169,10,0,,0,,0,,0,,1," ",0,,0,,0,,11,"           ",0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,6,"      ",1," LGTM.",0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,1," ",0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,

I feel like this should be the primary method for adding filters, since normally you just care about adding filters  and don't want to create your own `HttpFilters` and accidentally forget to add the `DefaultFilters`. In that case maybe we should use `play.filters.enabled` as the key.\r\n\r\nThe other question is how to deal with users who are currently overriding `play.http.filters` or using `Filters` at the root. If we decide to split out existing functionality (like forwarded headers) into default filters, that functionality would break because they're replacing all the filters.\r\n  ",0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,13,"             ",0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,14,"              ",1," LGTM.",0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,

There is a fallback encoding that can read both urlencoded-SHA1-signed cookies or JWT, and write out a JWT.\r\n\r\nThis is based on JJWT as it depends on Jackson 2.8 and has no other dependencies.\r\n\r\nThe encode / decode methods are overridden to leverage JWT to and from Map[String, String].  The issued-at and not-before claims are written out, and there's an optional id.  There is an expiration option, which will render the JWT useless past a certain date.  This is neat, as it gives us the benefits of browser expiration and server side token expiration automatically.\r\n\r\nFor session, JWT expiration mapped to the same as `maxAge`.  For Flash, there is no JWT expiration.\r\n\r\nThe cookie information is a custom claim that can be defined through configuration.  The JWT configuration is broken out so that people who want custom cookies can leverage functionality without having to add it in themselves.\r\n\r\nThere is also some minor clean up of Flash and Session traits, making method returns explicit and removing SessionConfiguration from code and defining the domain explicitly.\r\n\r\nI note that we don't include anything about `CookieBaker` and the benefit from being able to float a custom type to and from cookie format -- we do this for Play JSON through `Reads` and `Writes` so it's a bit strange it isn't mentioned in the docs and we make people work with raw `Cookie`.

Seeing as how reading the source code had been helpful for me, I thought I'd do some static analysis, find some stuff to clean up and then submit said cleanup. Kinda like the boy scout rule, which is mentioned in the 'contributing' page.\r\n\r\nThis PR limits itself to the `play-java` sub-project.\r\n\r\n## References\r\n\r\nNo references\r\n\r\nSo yeah. general cleanup. It makes the code a bit cleaner. I fully understand if you're all like ""we don't actually need this right now"".\r\n\r\nThings that changed:\r\n* \* imports changed to fully qualified imports.\r\n* Seemingly pointless `matcher.matches();` calls removed.\r\n* 2 duplicate primitive assignments fixed\r\n* for loop into while loop, which seems more logical for the intended functionality of that bit of code\r\n* Use of JDK8's `computeIfAbsent` functionality, which is expressly intended for ""check if map index is null, if so add something at that index"" scenarios.\r\n* Removing redundant escapes in a regex.

These bodies are available immediately, and don't need\nstream materialization to handle them.\n\nPlay's action design requires that all request bodies be handled as\nstreams, since an action is defined to be a Sink that materializes to a\nfuture of the response, so the only way to pass a body into a Play\naction is to feed a Source of the body into that Sink. Even if that body\nis a 100 byte body that has already been buffered by Akka HTTP as a\nstrict entity, and even if actions handling is to simply fold all the\nbyte strings received together, Play's design still requires that this\nin memory body be wrapped in a Source.single, and then fed into a\nSink.fold(_ ++ _). No matter how much Akka streams improves the\nperformance of its materialization, this materialization will always be\nunnecessarily done and a burden on Play's performance.\n\nPlay has already added a fast path for when there is no request body,\nand the action is not interested in consuming a request body (such as\nfor GET requests), in the form of a DoneAccumulator, which both the\nNetty and Akka HTTP server implementations use by invoking this fast\npath when there is no body.\n\nFix:\n\nThis change adds a StrictAccumulator implementation of Accumulator, which\nallows an accumulator to specify a fast path that avoids using streams\n(and hence materialization) for when there is just one or zero elements to\nhandle. It deletes the DoneAccumulator, and replaces its usage with\nStrictAccumulator, since StrictAccumulator can achieve everything that\nthe DoneAccumulator can. Both of these classes are private\nimplementation details of accumulator, there is no public API that has\nbeen broken to make these changes, the factory methods for creating a\ndone accumulator still exist, just implemented using the struct\naccumulator.\n\nThe body parsers that buffer the full body have been modified to use the\nnew strict accumulator, and the Akka HTTP server implementation has been\nmodified to take advantage of the new run method that has been added to\nAccumulator which triggers the StrictAccumulator fast path.\n\nThe Netty server implementation hasn't been modified at all - there's no\npoint, since it does not yet support buffering small bodies in a single\nmessage, and can only be handled with streams.\n\nStill to be done:\n\n* Tests for the Java accumulator have yet to be written\n* The Java body parsers do not yet use this.",closed,false,2017-04-05T23:46:09.000Z,2017-04-18T21:25:13.000Z,2017-04-18T21:25:13.000Z,true,,2,3,4,1,299,74,6,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,1," LGTM, but I am wondering if it would make things simpler if we had a specific type like `AccumulatorSource` that could have three different cases for zero, one and many.

If there isn't a caching API available, then it doesn't.  You can turn off caching even if it is available, and tune and rename cache configuration parameters.\r\n\r\n## Background Context\r\n\r\nThis PR is a bit fiddly, because it depends on another library, play-standalone-ws, which by its nature can't depend on any Play APIs.  So we use JCache as the intermediary.  We also can't use play.api.SyncCacheApi, because the key is a String.  So, we use the JCache implementation, but that's not bound and provided through dependency injection, but resolved through the classloader.
