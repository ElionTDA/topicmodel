By default, no separator will be added between each crumbs.\n\nFor the templates, I went with what I think are sane default. Feel free to comment on this.\n\nOnce this is approved, I'll document the docblocks a bit more (to give more details about the arguments of the `render()` methods for instance and how to customize the ""innerAttrs"") and write something for the book.\n\nRefs #9542 \n",closed,false,2016-10-03T20:19:23.000Z,2016-11-12T16:28:09.000Z,2016-11-12T16:28:07.000Z,true,,14,45,68,18,811,0,3,5,"     ",1," ",4,"    ",0,,1," ",1," Looks good to me.\n",0,,0,,11,"           ",1," ",0,,0,,1," ",0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,2,"  ",0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,1," Great work @HavokInspiration!\n",0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,17,"                 ",0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,

Ideally I'd like to throw, but this would introduce a thrown exception into something that doesn't already throw. \n\nIf this looks all ok, I'll forward-port this to 3.x (I did it into 2.x first as that's what I know better)\n\nRequested by cakephp/cakephp#9560\n",closed,false,2016-10-04T08:04:50.000Z,2016-10-08T00:40:23.000Z,2016-10-08T00:40:23.000Z,true,,4,37,41,1,51,0,2,3,"   ",1," ",5,"     ",0,,3,"   ",1," Looks good to me.\n",1," Looking good.

Shore up some of the implementation gaps we have around nonces. Nonces should expire and should be generated by the server. I've followed the Symfony approach to generating nonces which results in short lived (5 minutes by default) nonces that are regenerated each time the client receives a 401.\n\nBy validating and requiring nonce rotation we can avoid replay attacks with our Digest authentication implementation.\n\nI've targetted 3.next as validating/requiring nonce rotation is a behavior change that I feel could trip up application developers. By including it in a minor release we can more effectively communicate the changes.\n\nRefs #9668\n,closed,false,2016-10-30T04:29:22.000Z,2016-11-03T00:17:48.000Z,2016-10-31T08:43:03.000Z,true,,3,4,4,3,272,85,2,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,1," ",0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,2,"  ",0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,1," ",0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,

Can be done later.\r\n\r\nWorth mentioning:\r\n\r\n- `Query::bufferResults($enablel)` is now `enableBufferedResults()`/`isEnabledBufferedResults()`.\r\n- `Connection::useSavePoints($enable)` is now `enableSavePoints()`/`isEnabledSavePoints()`.\r\n\r\nBetter ideas for names welcome.

These are immutable versions of `type()` and `location()`. Unfortunately this spiraled a bit out of control as I wanted to keep the tests passing. However, I've:\r\n\r\n* Fixed getHeaders() not always following PSR7 interface requirements  when headers are set with `header()`.\r\n* Restored behavior where the status code is set to 302 when a location  header is set and the current status is 200.\r\n* Eagerly set the 'Content-Type' header so that charset(), type() and  withType() all result in the content-type header being correctly set.   This also fixes an issue where the content type would not be correctly  set when the response was emitted.\r\n\r\nRefs #9636",closed,false,2016-11-18T03:37:05.000Z,2016-11-22T01:54:04.000Z,2016-11-22T01:54:00.000Z,true,,3,7,9,6,305,312,3,0,,0,,0,,0,,3,"   ",0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,1," ",0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,3,"   ",0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,

Changing one of them would probably break things.\r\n\r\nMy way to improve this is to check if a new association name matches the target table alias **after** it has been resolved.\r\n\r\nThere's also an issue with `AssociationCollection` not reflecting association name change, but I'm not sure we can do anything about it without changing the way associations are collected.",closed,false,2017-02-03T09:53:03.000Z,2017-02-08T08:58:03.000Z,2017-02-07T17:58:28.000Z,true,,4,1,0,2,43,0,2,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,1," Looks ok to me, but needs some tests.",0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,

This is particularly important when a table stores a million+ rows and a column can be stored as one byte (`tinyint`) instead of 4 (`int`).\r\n\r\nTests are provided.",closed,false,2017-03-04T05:31:34.000Z,2017-03-12T16:27:46.000Z,2017-03-12T16:27:46.000Z,true,,12,26,31,12,179,30,15,0,,0,,0,,0,,6,"      ",1," Looks good to me.",0,,0,,1," ",0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,6,"      ",0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,1," Minor nitpicking from me, as usual 😼 ",0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,11,"           ",0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,

The related test cases don't pass with PHPUnit 4.8. I noticed this issue when I was working to make CakePHP 2.x compatible with PHPUnit 4.8 for my project. Then I checked 3.x branch and noticed that the related test cases had been fixed in a wrong way. That was why I reported #10339).\r\n- Added PHPUnit 4.8 to test matrix\r\n- ~~Added CakeFinalizer class. PHPUnit 4.8 marks test cases as 'risky', if the output buffering level is different before and after the test. CakeFinalizer allows us to adjust the output buffering level, when we want to test some function which changes the output buffering level and throws an exception.~~\r\n- Fixed several risky tests.\r\n    - Fixed CakeTestCase::run() to restore original output buffering level\r\n    - Fixed an undefined variable warning in missing_controller.ctp\r\n    - Fixed ViewTest (backport of 92bd86274b64c31ef6034caa74bb168be041b5e0)\r\n    - Fixed ThemeViewTest\r\n\r\nI have not changed `composer.json` as I think that using PHPUnit 4.8 is optional. So, for now, only a test is running with PHPUnit 4.8. However, It may be arguable.

By reworking how we generate aliases and eagerloader aliases we can enable the `targetTable` option to behave as intended. The foreignKey will need to be set, when used with `targetTable` and a table that doesn't have a matching alias, but I think that is reasonable given how key generation uses the table's alias for other reasons.\r\n\r\nI've had to replace target aliases with the association names, so that the selected fields reflect the association's alias and not the table's original alias. I don't think this will cause problems with application code that relies on the target table's alias being used, as aliases always had to match between the association and table instance. One situation that could be problematic with the new code is if a user is using `$table->aliasField()` in query expressions for association finders. Because the table's alias and association alias no longer have be the same, mismatching aliases could end up in the same query.\r\n\r\nRefs #7125\r\nRefs #10410",closed,false,2017-03-15T02:32:23.000Z,2017-03-15T19:31:35.000Z,2017-03-15T07:13:57.000Z,true,,4,1,1,1,46,25,5,0,,0,,0,,0,,1," ",0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,

Given that changing the path was the original intent, I thought that might be a more consistent option name. Furthermore, the previous changes would result in awkward reverse routing scenarios where the routing parameter would not match the controller/model name, and instead match the resource name. e.g. `resources('BlogPosts', ['controller' => 'articles'])` would use `blog_post_id` as the routing parameter instead of `article_id` which does not match the conventions used elsewhere in the framework.\r\n\r\ncc @chrisShick \r\n",closed,false,2017-04-11T02:06:42.000Z,2017-04-13T19:00:06.000Z,2017-04-13T19:00:04.000Z,true,,6,5,3,1,27,12,3,0,,1," ",0,,0,,1," ",0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,2,"  ",0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,1," ",0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,

Most of the issues were missing annotations, however there were some minor code changes. I broke up my changes into separate commits for better clarity as well as to allow cherry-picking.\r\n\r\nFYI: I avoided the best I could adding missing annotations for deprecated code, wasn't sure it was absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\n~~P.S.

An example might be falling back to the FileEngine if Redis fails to connect:\r\n\r\n```php\r\nCache::setConfig('tests', [\r\n    'engine' => 'Redis',\r\n    'host' => 'badhost',\r\n    'fallback' => 'tests_fallback'\r\n]);\r\nCache::setConfig('tests_fallback', [\r\n    'engine' => 'File',\r\n    'path' => TMP,\r\n    'prefix' => 'test_',\r\n]);\r\n```\r\n\r\nA developer could configure fallbacks all the way to the NullEngine in order to prevent their app from ever throwing an exception due to missing cache.\r\n\r\nI'd like to discuss potential pitfalls (especially regarding groups, as I do not have much experience with them) of this change.
