Writing the definition over the past 2 weeks surfaced a number of inconsistencies in interfaces, docs, tests and debug scripts leading to 45 pull requests. So not only is it useful for people using Typescript, but it adds another check for correctness in the project. The definition file is based off of https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/tree/master/leaflet, but fully re-written for 1.0.\n\nThe tests file, besides testing every single interface, also includes all of the code in debug/ which I think is a good sampling of edge cases and code in the wild.\n\nSince most of the interfaces and types are defined in the docstrings, I worked on a tool to auto-generate the definition file from the docs. This worked ok, but not well enough to be automated, so that's not included.\n\nThe reason I think this should live in the Leaflet repo (besies the DefinitelyTyped repo), is to keep it in sync with the current master version and each release. DefinitelyTyped would always have the latest stable. Immutable.js takes this approach: https://github.com/facebook/immutable-js/tree/master/type-definitions\n\nTests are run strictly with --noImplicitAny.

This leaves the possibility that the user only taps the map, without starting to drag. In this situation, the animation will be aborted, but no map movement will be registered by `Map.Drag`, so no `moveend` event will be fired, neither for the `flyTo` animation or the drag.\r\n\r\nThis in turn becomes a problem since it's reasonable to assume a `flyTo` call will be succeeded by a `moveend` at some point, either when the animation finishes or when it's aborted - clearly the map has moved by then.\r\n\r\nI looked through other usages of `Map._stop`, and it appears it is otherwise only used where a `moveend` will be fired, so `Map.Drag` is an exception, which is not guaranteed to fire a `moveend`.\r\n\r\nAn alternative to this fix would be to make `Map._stop` fire a `moveend` if an animation is interrupted - this would also make sense to me, but at the same time seems to be a potentially more intrusive fix: we would sometimes fire multiple `moveend` events where we today only fire one, potentially causing problems for existing apps.",closed,false,2017-03-08T11:39:19.000Z,2017-03-08T14:41:06.000Z,2017-03-08T14:41:02.000Z,true,,0,6,5,3,1,5,1,3,"   ",1," ",0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,2,"  ",0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,
