this out and let you know what I find Hi I ve tried spoon net out but unfortunately had to use something else spoon net doesn t give anything like long enough to try something out without having to

work fine in FF and IE7 8 and 9 with no apparent side effects It has revealed though that there seem to be some problems with toolbox history js for the 1 2 7 branch so I will take a look at that and

I ve updated my JSFiddle with the code http jsfiddle net alibby251 8srNe 1 However I m getting some really wierd results in IE9 I ve had to test this as a standalone file using the code from JSFiddle IE9 didn t want to allow going backwards for the output frame When running the demo as a standalone file I was either getting the back forward buttons being enabled at inappropriate times or the backward button jumping from tab 3 to 1 despite having gone via tab 2 on the outbound journey A restart of IE then didn t show any back or forward buttons being enabled at all when testing I need to test this further trust me there were some unexpected results coming back @duclet I ve tested this more although I am not 100 sure I ve gotten the links to your pull request right unfortunately I m

clicking on the back button to go through the tabs it drops the #tag for me on the first 4 clicks if you ve clicked through from 1 to 4 afresh in a new browser window If you ve clicked through more than this it seems to drop the highlight on the tabs although it will change the URL and hash tag shown in the address bar I have also seen it suddenly jump from tab 4 to 1 if I ve originally gone from tab 1 to 4 in turn This has not been consistent on any of the attempts I ve tried I know there is an outstanding issue where if you have a URL with a hash tag that it doesn t allow you to go directly to that tab if using a new browser window I don t know if this is actually part of the problem here Accepting the pull request for #76 on its own doesn t feel right just at this stage until

the screen with your mouse scroll wheel The result is that the overlay appears above your display area and consequently the user is not able to see the overlay and close the overlay so the user just sees the mask the user is unable to do anything and has to click refresh","I could not find a good solution to this Right now you can only avoid this issue by setting the configuration variable fixed false i am guessing but the effect code gets it target position before the animation starts then moves the object The code needs changing so the target position is continuously updated during the animation The temporary fix i have implemented is to check the position after the overlay is fully open and animation is complete and check it is visible it it is not i move it into view without any animation The solution is crude and fixes the issue but not in a nice way can I see your fix thanks my fix is not nice onLoad calls a function with var top content offset top window scrollTop if top 0 overlayDiv css top 0px overlayDiv data img css top 0px Also becuase the popup is fixed i dont want it any larger than the users screen size since they will not be able to scroll over the hidden content var maxHeight window height top content css max height maxHeight px you could do the same with width The issue is with position fixed content is the user can not scroll to it or around it So i therefore have to check it is visible with both scroll position and with and height The other issue is that you set isOpened to true before the apple animation starts not after So any calls to this function returns true even though it not actually open yet A good example of this issue is 1 on document ready you open a overlay popup 2 the URL is widget html#some_location_down_the_page the overlay starts opening before the browser scrolls down the page to #some_location_down_the_page The result is the overlay when open is out of sight up the page somewhere because it is position fixed you cant scroll back to it either The user just sees the mask and no close button Another example is as i mentioned before to open the overlay and use your mouse wheel to scroll during the animation I think you could fix this quite easily The issue is the animated content is positioned relative to the document The document can move if the scrolled The solution is to put the animated content inside a static container So simply wrap the overlay with a div whose css position fixed top 0 left 0 and also set the width and height of it to match the browser window size and finally overflow auto You then dont need to make the overlay fixed or worry about it being visible if the overlay is larger than the browser the container will show scroll bars If the browser scrolls during the animation the container will remain static so the overlay will remain in perfect position Further to my response here i tried my solution as a test it works it needs implementing within your overlay code however as when you create the IMG layer it is outside my container The result is that as i scroll up and down the page the overlay stays static but he background image does not I HAVE ONLY TESTED THIS IN CHROME this is what i did lt div class overlayContainer lt div id overlay lt div id contentWrap lt div lt div lt div CSS overlayContainer position fixed top 0 left 0 #overlay overlay fixed false effect apple To implement this nicely when the user selects fixed true the code should wrap the overlay with this wrapper with position fixed rather than apply position fixed to the overlay when it creates the IMG layer with the background that too needs to be inside this container I hope this help kind regards austin PS Your library is great this is now fixed thanks to your latest comment here is the commit http github com jquerytools jquerytools commit 12f70d55b37ea91a19e61929e9fa47a9cd97c663 and here is the updated apple effect http github com jquerytools jquerytools raw

dont see any container being added but I can see you have changed how you position the IMG does this solve the issue What is the best way for me to test this and give you feedback i have currently just used your download page to get all the projects you dont have a nightly download page do you if i copy the code into a new js file and load this after will it overwrite the existing code Or should i download the project less the apple effect and then load this new code ta right now there is no nightly build I suggest you include follwing files http cdn jquerytools org 1 2 4 jquery tools

javascript 2 for most cases it is fixed I could create one instance where it was still broken a If i click a link and scroll during the animation it is fixed b If i set document ready to open a overlay on document load and scroll whilst the page is loaded then it is broken It is broken in a different way though If i am scrolling down then it appears further down the page than it should it use to appear up the page in the position before scrolling So now it looks like the animation is fine but the target position is wrong I have tested in both chrome and IE 7 8 with the same results my fix for this is onLoad to check the position with this var top content offset top window scrollTop var sh window height if top 20 top sh 2 overlayDiv css top 20px overlayDiv data img css top 20px If you are unable to find the cause then maybe you shoudl put this final check in your code forget what i have said here i found the root cause scroll down the page a bit now click a button and the overlay is opened out of sight After playing with the code i see the cause is the following lines which with the following change fixes the issue var itop conf start top Math round w height 2 ileft conf start left Math round w width 2 if trigger var p getPosition trigger itop p top ileft p left I HAVE ADDED THE FOLLOWING CHECK HERE 1 OF 2 CHANGES if conf fixed itop w scrollTop ileft w scrollLeft initialize background image and make it visible img css position position top itop left ileft width 0 zIndex conf zIndex show I HAVE ADDED THE FOLLOWING CHECK HERE 2 OF 2 CHANGES if conf fixed pos top w scrollTop pos left w scrollLeft pos position position overlay css pos This might need some more testing As you no doubt already know with fixed positioning the co ordinates are relative to the browser and not the document so you need to use scrollTop to calculate the start position relative to the browser but you dont want it for the end position hope this helps ok did this http github com

overlay apple js how does that work for you it works very nicely thank you tested in chrome and IE 7 when are you going to make this live cheers Austin this next week The only other improvement i might suggest is to not allow the overlay width and height to be any larger than the screen visible area will permit when position is fixed Since due to it being fixed the user will not be able to scroll around it my onLoad function does this in a crude way with var top content offset top window scrollTop var sh window height var maxHeight sh top 30 10 px content css max height maxHeight I guess you could provide a configuration parameter to allow this restriction to be switchable the maximum width is set with CSS yes i would normally agree except the max width or hight needs to be equal to the visible screen size cant do this with css

issue The tooltips are appearing as I would expect them to do so I did update the code to 1 2 6 released since this was written but with no difference I just tested the demo I posted above as is http jsfiddle net D7wtF and it does _not_ work as expected Be sure to reposition the images within the window so that the images align with the very bottom of the window Then hover over the images The tooltip _should_ display off screen below the image hidden outside of the visual window however instead it displays the tooltip above the image This is not correct According to the code we have told the tooltip to always display down no matter what I updated the code to use 1 2 6 and the issue still exists Here I ve made a screen capture video showing the bug via the demo I posted above http screencast o matic com watch cln3Y8a9n Hi ColinY2K I ve had another look I think I may need to clarify something You ve mentioned that you ve added down to the dynamic plugin options and that your expectation is that the tooltip would appear below the image even though the image is at the edge of the screen so technically the tooltip image would appear off screen right Updating the code from 1 2 5 to 1 2 6 has not had any apparent effect either Unfortunately I think there s been a little misunderstanding here this is actually not what the down keyword does In this instance I believe the code is actually correct the down keyword here actually describes the _sliding motion of the tooltip_ and not where it will be positioned In a nutshell this means that no matter where the tooltip lands it will slide down into place Whenever the tooltip is set to use the dynamic plugin it will appear where the code states it should in this instance bottom center which is the default as you rightly say However if it deems that there is not enough clear space for the tooltip to appear i e when the images are at the bottom as in this example then it will always show them on the opposite edge to that specified in the code In this instance as you used bottom center the tooltips will appear in top center which is the opposite edge to that specified in the code The key bit is that if the dynamic tooltip has been configured for use then the tooltips will always reposition themselves within the viewport so that they are visible Does this help clarify it I m assuming this is now resolved

working on collecting bugs and fixes for 1 2 6 any chance you could please submit this as a pull request if you have not already done so I ll see what I can do I m not too familiar with using git so it may take me a few days to work out the process So I finally had a chance to sit down and take a look at this again So far as I can tell the issue is no longer a problem Perhaps what I experienced was due to the web browser I was testing on at the time because I have been unable to reproduce the problem Additionally in taking a second look at the documentation I would be inclined to use the dynamic positioning plug in to avoid issues like this in the future This wouldn t address the problem if it still exists but does provide a decent work around I recommend closing this issue unless someone can substantiate the issue O K so I don t like to let things go unresolved like that I managed to load up some older browsers Firefox 3 6 and IE 8 for testing The problem persists in these browsers The fix outlined above is fairly simple so I ll go ahead and make the modifications and submit a pull request I did not develop a comprehensive sample of test cases so I can t say if any conflicts are introduced I did look at the sample files and the tooltip placement appeared to be correct except in the case of nested positioned elements The placement of tooltips on positioned elements appears to be constrained somewhat by the available dimensions of the containing element though more testing is needed Hi bsweeney From reading your posts in more detail I m curious about a comment of yours in your last but one post I m intrigued as to why you think using the dynamic plugin does not address the problem but provides a decent workaround As far as I am aware the reason for the dynamic plugin was to allow for this Furthermore whilst I can understand this may exist in IE8 is there a reason you are still using Firefox 3 6 given that the latest version is now version 7 To me if a browser window is resized then yes you will always have this inherent issue it is possible that the dynamic plugin would include the functionality that tooltip would otherwise need but in an additional file and not as part of the default tooltip I m guessing that Tero probably felt that not everyone would want to include the functionality for dynamic plugin as default as people may not want it present for some reason This way it means people can activate it if they need it at minimal overhead to the rest of the script they are using Regarding tooltip placement you make a valid point However 1 Viewed as a UI object it s a bit of a design failure to have an interface element intended to present information display off the screen 2 The behavior is inconsistent across browsers It s more the latter point that leads me to believe this is a bug You could be correct that it was an intentional decision to make dynamic positioning an extra a moving tooltip could break the intended design of the site but let s disregard that The problem I was having is that there was room to render the tooltip it was just being rendered too wide I was expecting at least some minimal amount of calculation to account for the available space And this is how it works in the latest Firefox Tooltip placement was only part of the issue The other being the tooltip width shrinking on successive displays This behavior seems to me to be a bug A browser bug perhaps it does work as expected in FF7 IE9 But working around browser inconsistencies is one of the benefits of libraries right I myself do not use Firefox 3 6 That just happens to be the browser I was using at the time I ran into the issue So I went in search of a copy to confirm that the issue was valid The browser I am using however is not as important as the browser in use by visitors to the sites I maintain I still have a not insignificant number of visitors using the cited browsers versions 40 50 Please submit pull request

tab and shift tab is quite a pain Consider the situation where you have a page title and a footer which are outside the scrollable wizard Few controls are placed on the page title bar which is before the wizard and footer which is after the wizard Now user moves into the wizard 1 By pressing tab on a control placed before the wizard 2 By pressing shift tab on a control placed after the wizard In both cases the current wizard page must come into consideration In case 1 if the user should be navigated to the first control on the current page in the wizard In case 2 user should move to last control on the current page At present both these cases move the wizard page halfway across creating a very shabby impression I think this is a very real life scenario because it is difficult to imagine a page with only the scrollable wizard which is the only case where this bug will not be reproduced","I have managed to bypass this for the time being but my solution is not generic Here it is pre if tab is pressed on tabexit element move to signin element root find tabexit keydown function e var event window event e var keyCode event keyCode event which if keyCode 9 event shiftKey seeks to next tab by executing our validation routine lnkSignIn focus IE does not have e preventDefault if event preventDefault event preventDefault else return false if shift tab is pressed on tabentry

validation routine btnHomePage focus if event preventDefault event preventDefault else return false pre As you can see btnHomePage tab able element just before the wizard and lnkSignIn tab able element just after the wizard are specific to my page Scrollable wizard needs to provide for these elements as parameters in it s constructor and implement two more functions internally as given below pre Shift Tab on sign in link should take user to tab exit element on current wizard page lnkSignIn onkeydown function e var event window event e var keyCode event keyCode event which if keyCode 9 event shiftKey lastelements root find tabexit lastelements api getIndex focus if event preventDefault event preventDefault else return false Tab on homepage element should take user to first element on the current wizard page btnHomePage onkeydown function e var event window event e var keyCode event keyCode event which if keyCode 9 event shiftKey firstelements root find tabentry firstelements api getIndex focus if event preventDefault event preventDefault else return false pre Hope the solution is clear enough Do respond in case of any queries Hey this workaround looks almost as ugly as mine I resorted to hidden anchors From just reading your code I m not sure whether it can handle the following ugly cases 1 What happens when you do not have an anchor button or form in the active item 2 You have tabbed to e g an anchor in the active scrollable item Now navigate by other means to a different page then hit tab again Will try your method too and see how it handles it But finding a generic solution for this seems very hard Thanks for bringing this up Another thing to bear in mind when working with key codes Some browsers use different default keys e g Opera Shift Arrow instead of Tab which _might_ not matter here at least when scrollable keyboard is on the latter disabling Shift Arrow navigation in Opera anyway Speaking of compatibility AFAIR jquery s event preventDefault is crossbrowser compatible at least it works fine for me tm even in IE That s right this solution is not clean but that s the best I could think of for the moment The second case is not quite clear to me though what do you mean by other means There is a small piece of code which I missed earlier Hopefully that will take care of your concern Here it is pre Set focus on first control of this page api onSeek function event i firstelements root find tabentry if firstelements i firstelements i focus pre This ensures that after page change the first tab able control receives focus Again this assumes that at least one such element is present on the page c est la vie About the keyCodes yes there are quite a few compatibility concerns and I have tried this code with IE8 FF3 6 12 Opera 10 63 and Chrome 10 Haven t used AFAIR but I guess the current code works well with all browsers given here Dude you just saved me Thanks heaps for the solution One problem though is that safafi on iOS when you press next prev is kinda like tabs but not It has the same problem but I don t think it triggers this code So I just have to find the trigger for that and it ll work on everything Closing due to age it has been 4 years since an update If this is still an issue and given changes to browsers since this was originally logged please reopen I think it would be good to see a demo of the issue in action

numerical value and drops this into the output We need to ascertain if there is any escape character that is being used or should be used to prevent this from happening I believe I have a solution for this I ll see if I can post a bug fix here later Hi duclet Thanks if you do have a solution can you please post I m happy to test and validate it if it works OK I can look at getting it committed to the dev version P S I could potentially use your help on something else can you please email me at alex_libby_at_ntlworld_dot_com no underscores and I will explain Oh I thought I posted a response with my findings on this Turns out this isn t as easy as I thought because of how the escaping work Nevertheless I have two possible solutions in mind I ll try to get them done this week for testing sorry been on vacation the past two weeks so haven t done much in terms of work at all Okay I ended up with some time this morning and got some possible solutions for this First here is the fiddle with the bug http jsfiddle net duclet DLbzX Now the first solution is to simply replace all the escaped characters with some kind of placeholder text go thru the string is process it then restore the placeholder text The problem with this though is what we do not really no which character gets escaped I have tried searching and have not find a solution so if someone knows let me know So in order for this to work you basically have to escape the escape character In your example it would be dd de Anywhere here is the fiddle with this solution http jsfiddle net duclet DLbzX 2 Personally I m not all too fond of the double escaping so I thought maybe and this inspiration comes from MooTools and other libraries I have looked at is to use a prefix for text that will be processed So for this solution you need to prefix all strings which should be converted with the percent symbol It really doesn t fix the problem but it is more of a mask Nevertheless here is the second solution I came up with http jsfiddle net duclet DLbzX 3 As I was doing this I thought to myself maybe someone want to create a formatter for their own needs and didn t want to wait for a release cycle to get it in So this third solution basically allows you to add formatters much like you would add effects Simply call tools dateinput addFormatter name function to add a formatter The function is given four arguments the text to be updated with the date the actual date object the flags object containing the translation between the a string and its formatted version and the lang This of course adds another option to the conf called formatter which is the name of the formatter to use The current version is the default and I have added the second solution as the prefixed version Anyway here is that version http jsfiddle net duclet DLbzX 4 Hey mauri I hope you are still watching this do you have any views on the fixes listed by duclet The same applies for anyone who reads the post I m keen to get feedback on which is the preferred solution Any feedback and which solution we want here I m in favor of the last one so it provides more flexibility I would go with that option if you haven t heard anything by the end of the month On 23 01 2012 18 45 Duc Tri Le wrote Any feedback and which solution we want here I m in favor of the last one so it provides more flexibility Reply to this

non when viewed from within Chrome 25 using an offline copy of the minimal setup demo upon which the JSfiddle demo I ve mentioned above was based Admittedly this has had some slight changes to allow for jQuery 1 9 1 but these are minimal they were to remove any reference to the browser object which is currently used in some of the Tools It actually does not show up in your example I will try to create a demo as it definitely does in my app The exception would not help as I am using ASP NET MVC and that is a simple Resource not found exception as there is no URL non action controller An update I ve just thought of something which was off the back of rainwiz s comment div#expose is only used when you have explicitly set a background within your Overlay code which suggests that you may have something like this set mask color #ebecff loadSpeed 200 opacity 0 9 but don t have a reference to Expose within your call to the jQuery Tools library Could this be the case I just compared the apple effect example as I am using it with mine At the place the non is inserted in my app the example inserts http jquerytools org media img overlay transparent png @Expose Yes I have set Expose and what do you mean by reference to Expose I was able to reproduce it Save the apple effect standalone demo http jquerytools org demos overlay apple htm to a local html file and open it There it also tries to add an img but with URL file D media img overlay transparent png in my case but you see the border Unbenannt https f cloud github com assets 1186179 241246 6f6df55a 899c 11e2 8920 f846bb5d15dc jpg Hi chrfin Hehe I think I know what is going on here I think Google Chrome blocks references to local files that use the file protocol It s done for security reasons you will need to alter your code to turn it into a relative URL to that file or look at the demo through a local webserver such as XAMPP or WAMP The reference to Expose this is part of the library used by Overlay in certain situations I wanted to make sure that you had included this correctly if this was being used the original comment from rainwiz is actually a red herring it s not required if you are using the apple effect unless if you have a colored background show when the Overlay is active but the main question to me still remains WHY is this IMG inserted at all IMO it is not necessary and causing the problem HI chrfin It s a required part of the Overlay if you are using the apple effect if you don t want it then you will need to take this out from the Overlay script call I m not sure it is actually the true cause I think the true cause is actually Chrome which doesn t allow use of locally referenced files via the file protocol I ve run this in hundreds of demos within all of the major browsers and have never had an issue with it It sounds like the Overlay effect you actually need is more akin to the Simple Overlay demo as shown here http jsfiddle net alibby251 Mz7vh 4 It s the same as on the site but adjusted to work with jQuery 1 9 1 As an alternative if you still want to maintain a background of some sorts it is possible to replace the image with a pure CSS only solution instead To get a similar effect you will need to use a mix of CSS 2 and CSS 3 styles Thats the funny thing I do NOT have any kind of image in my overlay not in the div itselve nor via CSS background or so which is why I am wondering where it is comming from Can you set up a copy of what you are seeing in a JSfiddle please www jsfiddle net so I can see it please The image you are referring to is a standard part of the Apple effect for Overlay so I am a little puzzled as to what is going on If you tell me a way to contact you e g e mail I can give you access to my app and you can see the real usage Sure please email me via alex_libby_at_ntlworld_dot_com no underscores I can then have a look and see what is going on FYI I worked around the problem by not using the apple effect Thanks to

59thb8ayd Commenting out the following lines solved the problem for me lines 107 109 in https github com jquerytools jquerytools blob master src tooltip tooltip js javascript if iPad i test navigator userAgent top window scrollTop The solution from jpavril worked for me I had to download the jquery tools js instead of using the CDN version but the edited code looks like this javascript var scrollY window pageYOffset javascript iPad i test navigator userAgent e scrollY It worked in both landscape and portrait There were a couple of syntax issues that weren t exactly perfect for people looking for a copy and paste solution Thanks Hey this solution doesn t work for me The scrollY bug still appears on my iPad I am using iPad i test navigator userAgent e window pageYOffset Any idea JPM1987 the only differences I see between your code and mine are that 1 I declare the variable outside the function shouldn t matter 2 I have spaces around again it shouldn t matter 3 I m using jQuery core v1 6 1 and you are using v1 7 1 email me at jferko@backpocketmedia com and I ll send you the exact jquery tools js file that I m using At least that way you could try it verbatim Thanks for your reply 1 and 2 shouldn t really matter I would give your file a try Best regards Edit Maybe it s only because I have to use relative true for my tooltips If I don t use this option the tooltips are displaced on all platforms PC Browsers and iPad Edit 2 Okay relative true is not the problem The bug still appears Sry for bumping but I could locate the issue I could specify the appereance of the bug The bug only appears if the page is getting reloaded while the site was scrolled down or opened by clicking the link to it Edit2 Got it working I am using jferkos version and deleted the ipad fixing part Thanks again to jess djamshed s solution of removing commenting out the iPad specific if statement solves the problem for me too javascript iPad position fix if iPad i test navigator userAgent top window scrollTop Seems like a simpler solution than the other suggested fix unless there s some other problem with it I m not aware of It looks like there was a workaround in jquerytools to fix the positioning problem in Safari on iOS see https github com jquerytools jquerytools commit 5926ae9d167e120ae26e18e7c5644869723c765d Now that Apple fixed the problem the workaround is counterproductive Therefore the workaround from the commit above can be removed But maybe there are still old iPads in the wild which need this workaround Has anyone an idea when Apple fixed the positioning problem Maybe we ll have to distinct old and new iPads respecitvely iOS versions Removing this code works fine for me I m using an iPad2 with iOS 5 1 1 Hi jrenggli Thanks for posting the update I ve been having a look online to see if I can pinpoint any more info on when Apple fixed this but so far nothing confirmed I m happy to consider this although it would be good to see if we can get any further indication of whether the issue still affects older versions of iOS AFAIK iOS5 is the most recent version of the OS sorry not an iPad owner perhaps it would be enough if we can get any confirmation from those still on version 4 I think iOS 5 came out in October last year or at least was available then can anyone confirm Hi all can any one help me to show tooltip on ipad can any one show me any example to show tooltip on ipad my application is in asp net Still not fixed I just tried out the demo page for jQuery Tools tooltip and had the problem Specifically I am seeing an issue if you scroll down slightly and then touch the image The tooltip will show up way above in that case Tooltip shows up way to high near top of view http is200 imagesocket com images 2012 09 25 2526486 30jc png Using iPad 2 with 5 1 1 Hi Have you tried jrenggli s fix as outlined above It would help to know if this works so we can consider if it can be applied to the next version of Tools I ve tried both these fixes within jquery tools min js e g removing the iPad specific code and changing the code to include var scrollY window pageYOffset iPad i test navigator userAgent e scrollY Neither of these work Is it because I m making the change within the minified script I d try it in the main source file but I can t find where to download it anywhere on the downloadpage it says that both minified and source versions are available but all I can seem to download is the minified version Can anyone point me in the direction of the source code download and let me know if making the changes in this file will help when it hasn t in the minified version Thanks Hi getnorthern No problem the source code can be downloaded from here https github com jquerytools jquerytools you will need to change the branch from master to dev if you want to get the current dev version which will be the basis for 1 2 8 Otherwise master is the current source for Tools 1 2 7 I suspect this may help it is the unminified version that is stored here it should at least be easier to read To get to this page click on the Download link which should take you to http www jquerytools org download then click on Report a bug and click on the Code tab when you get to that page I confirm that removing below string from minified version of JS file has solved my problem javascript iPad i test navigator userAgent e a window

version 1 2 5 and upgrading the rest of the tools to 1 2 6 works Ok not sure which version of scrollable navigator I have the last version I presume and it makes the hash work just have to include it now but it should have been included in the 1 2 6 full You said you had navigator ver 1 2 5 where can I get that I have a version but its causing more problems hash link for one panel ends up way past the panel and I get double scroll randomly Guys This is now fixed I think I may be partially to blame for this one I suggested a change which appeared to fix another issue but in the end actually broke this one I ve reverted the change back as issue #701 So far all tests show that you can successfully navigate to a specific tab specified in a URL and the history now also goes back properly The code will be available as part of what will be Tools 1 2 7 which I am looking to release into production imminently @alibby251 You are saying that navigating to e g http jquerytools org documentation scrollable index html#plugins will work again Then great news At the moment even clicking on the tabs does nothing Hey blacktrash Based on all of the tests I ve done yes this should now be working in

view it on GitHub https github com jquerytools jquerytools issues 511#issuecomment 4532834 alibby sorry need some guidance here I previously used 1 2 6 full and then navigator to get it working But since you said it is fixed do I need to use 1 2 7 AND use history From the WWW site I downloaded 1 2 7 dev with navigator and history included in the download but its not working What am I doing wrong Note demos on the main jtools site still don t work with hash ref in URL Hi makebelieve Thanks for this yes the demos will still fail they will be updated with the next version of Tools that contains the fix To get at a copy of the fixed code for the History plugin you need to download it from the source file area from within Github here s the link for the file https raw github com jquerytools jquerytools dev src toolbox toolbox history js You can either download a copy of it or reference it in testing I would recommend saving a copy of it locally though You will need to include this on any demo where history is set to true in the Tools call please note though that as of 1 2 7 it will require you to use jQuery 1 7 1 there are code changes within Tools 1 2 7 that have had to be done in light of changes coming in jQuery itself I am looking to release 1 2 7 early next week if all goes well I still doubt that http jquerytools org documentation scrollable index html#plugins will work as documented i e whether it will scroll to #plugins on page load but will wait until the site is updated I still need the 1 2 5 scrollable navigator js on a site I am deploying the rest can be git HEAD I wonder if you got round to updating or releasing 1 2 7 or when this may happen Really need to go live with a site but this little bug is holding things up Hi makebelieve Apologies for the delay I ve had some teething troubles getting the files into a suitable format for the CDN links I m working on some final smoke testing this evening to iron out some remaining kinks if all is well I will be asking Tero to release the software asap Hey makebelieve blacktrash I m happy to say that Tools 1 2 7 is now finally on the site my initial tests of demos currently on the site over and above my local tests done as part of releasing the code seem to suggest that the demos now work as they should do Please feel free to give it a try you will need jQuery 1 7 1 or above to work with Tools 1 2 7 as a minimum Hi Alibby251 thanks for the update Unfortunately the demo here isn t working with the hash links http jquerytools org documentation scrollable index html I ve just tried 1 2 7 I can t seem to get the hash urls to jump to panel my history is to true Hi makebelieve Hehe that s not a good demo to use for the purposes of linking directly to hash tags Have a look at http jquerytools org demos tabs anchors html http jquerytools org demos tabs anchors html this demo uses named anchors upon which the hash tag URLs work I think this is more akin to what you are looking for If not please post a

history is to true Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub https github com jquerytools jquerytools issues 511#issuecomment 4965217 There is a consistent misunderstanding my original report is about this scrollable feature If you are using a tags inside the wrapper and you supply href attributes for them you have the added benefit of automatically seeking to the correct item when you enter the page with a matching hash of the URL See my original report here This now seems to have been silently omitted http jquerytools org documentation scrollable index html#demos does _not_ scroll to the demo pane As I repeatedly said this is not a problem with history but with scrollable navigator js and was broken in a69f655 see https github com jquerytools jquerytools commit a69f655e537bab8cadb33000021b6daaadf084c4#diff 1 It works with all the latest as long as you leave navigator at the parent revision of the above change https github com jquerytools jquerytools blob fcecfe6be63838252938f3d4c45d8abb0c7518c4 src scrollable scrollable navigator js See http www whitworthpeck com wwp html#links for a working sample I can implement it in other ways but I don t like when a feature is silently dropped See my comment from 6 months ago https github com jquerytools jquerytools commit a69f655e537bab8cadb33000021b6daaadf084c4#commitcomment 616240 Alibby this works http jquerytools org demos tabs anchors html#third and it does seek and reveal the third tab However as you click each tab it doesn t change the hash url Which is what it does if you use navigator js along with 1 2 7 I was hoping I wouldn t have to use navigator in order to get that functionality but using navigator I am getting a double scroll on the panels when scrolling backwards which otherwise doesn t occur Guys Apologies I m not sure where the confusion has arisen from I will get this looked at although it will have to be for what will become 1 2 8 makebelieve is right it will go directly to that URL which it was not doing in 1 2 6 so at least that bit is fixed @blacktrash Rest assured I have not silently dropped any feature intentionally I think part of this whole issue could have been due to the Tools library not having been updated for some time and that I was keen to right this by getting the library uptodate Now that you ve explained it for me I will work on getting this sorted out once and for all Thanks for taking the time to explain it I suspect I may not have fully understood what you were trying to achieve before EDIT I ve asked duclet who helped with 1 2 7 to have a proper look at this and to ensure we get it properly fixed this time around @alibby251 sorry if I sounded a bit harsh it s great that you take care of all this It just wasn t clear for ages whether this was an intentional change which then should have been documented because the feature caused problems with e g with multiple scrollables for example or just accidental It s relatively easy to implement at least for my purposes but I found it annoying that it was advertised for such a long time without working @blacktrash No apology needed it was my silly fault for completely mis reading your original posts I ve tested the version of Scrollable s Navigator at the revision you ve suggested this does indeed work for me on the various Scrollable demos available at present The only thing I ve noticed is that the hash tag is not shown on the first tag when immediately viewing the page after loading it but will be shown on the rest is this what you were expecting As there are a good number of changes in comparison to the current 1 2 8 dev version I suspect we may end up having to replace the code with this release in its entirety but I m not sure what this will mean It looks like some changes were made to accommodate pushState which I suspect may have contributed to breaking the automatic hash navigation I ve asked duclet for assistance on this as he has been helping with the current release I will post as soon as I have an answer Are you gonna release it anytime now Its already been 3 months and I feel this is a major bug that needs to be addressed as soon as possible Well the feature seems to have been silently dropped which is one way of fixing it The passage I quoted in my original post is not present anymore at http jquerytools org documentation scrollable index html You can implement something like it yourself though by querying location hash and then scroll to the corresponding item programmatically Hi Guys Apologies the feature has not been dropped I m without any support from a development perspective at this time as duclet who was helping me has had to focus on work committments at the moment I m trying to test things but as I am not a developer by trade I prefer to have someone confirm from a development perspective whilst I try to concentrate on maintaining the forums as much as I can Alex On 07 July 2012 at 00 12 Christian Ebert

match up with what s showing in your JSFiddle When I click on the first DateInput I get 28th September 2011 selected with a minimum set of the day before everything prior to 27th is disabled as I would expect If I click on DateInput number 2 I get 3rd September 2011 selected as I would expect and that the maximum date selectable is 2nd October which I would expect from the code given I can move back and forth as much as I would expect to be able to can you please confirm what you were expecting would show for you and what you were expecting should be showing Alibby Perhaps I was unclear but that is not what I m referring to This fix is about the next month previous month functionality The first input has a start value of 9 28 2011 And a minimum of 9 27 2011 If you click on next month arrow to go to October the previous month arrow is disabled and won t let you go back to September The second input has a start of 9 3 2011 and a max of 10 2 2011 I SHOULD be able to go forward to October since my max goes into that month Yes the next month arrow is disabled This behavior occurs in Chrome Firefox and IE9 Annotated screenshot from Chrome http screencast com t jFp0nlws Hi owenallenaz I ve had another look I think I can see what s going on I m still in two minds as to whether your patch gives any additional benefit I m going to try to explain where I am coming from on this For the purposes of the explanation wherever I mention placeholder days I m referring to the days that appear on each calendar from the previous or following months that fill in the spaces before and after the real days for that particular month On demo 1 I get exactly the same as you the start date is 28th September with a minimum set of 27th September If I go forward I don t get the opportunity to go back but that is because the min date shown on the October calendar is the third item in row 1 I would expect to see this as the min date is set to one of the days showing in the placeholder days on row 1 which is after the beginning of the view for October If I move onto November I will get the opportunity to move back or forward a month I would fully expect to be able to do this given that there are no disabled dates in November for this example The same would continue to apply until the month of any month where a max is set The same principle applies in demo 2 as the max is set to show on a date within that month you will not be able to move forward I think the question here is about where min and max are set particularly if it lands on one of the days that will appear on the next months view as a date placefiller before the start of the following month In example one if the max had been set to be earlier than 25th September which is the first date shown on October s view then you would be able to move back to September with no issue If your patch is applied I m assuming that it would show a previous arrow to take you back to September correct However I would question does this actually give any additional real benefit If the date had been earlier than 25th i e not one of the placefiller dates at the start of October you will get the arrow anyway I suspect if the previous arrow had been set to show then all you would see is a calendar with largely disabled dates and with 4 days only being available for selection All DateInput does now is stop you from seeing what would be an almost full month of disabled dates it shows the days from September that are selectable but just at the start of October This is purely because the placeholder days that are selectable from September are less than the number of placeholder spaces available if the min value had been set for the 24th September or earlier than I think you should find that the previous arrow will show on October From a personal perspective I think the view that is shown now is probably less confusing if the previous arrow was showing on September s view then people would be able to go back but would see a view largely full of disabled days I m not sure this would serve any real benefit except to confuse people I suspect that the view is more down to a matter of taste and not because of a bug in the code I hope this makes some form of sense and that I hope this explains why I couldn t see any issue

the minimal setup to see how it works like following input type date name startDate script type text javascript date dateinput script But when I run the page it starts to add class date to not only the input element but to all HTML elements before that It starts with html class date and continues downward until my input After my date input element though no more classes are added to the document What should I do","Can you perhaps modify this fiddle to show the issue I can t reproduce this issue http jsfiddle net duclet MZGAD Hi puppetmup I would have to agree with duclet I can t replicate this either using the basic dateinput demo It sounds like if the date class is being added then it is from something else It is possible to set the CSS prefix used on DateInput you haven t done this by any chance Hello Thanks for all help I tried starting a default ASP NET Webforms application both with example code and without only adding the datepicker and the scripts It still adds the date class to all the elements prior to and including the actual date input Example html xmlns http www w3 org 1999 xhtml xml lang en class date head class date title class date title link href Styles Site css rel stylesheet type text css class date script src Scripts jquery 1 7 1 min js type text javascript class date script script src Scripts jquery tools min js type text javascript class date script head body class date form method post action default aspx id ctl01 class date div class aspNetHidden date and so on I tested on Chrome Firefox and IE and the same thing happens To be certain I also downloaded only the dateinput part of the script and tried with that Same thing I also tried using jQuery 1 6 4 instead of 1 7 1 but the same result follows I tried running the script on document ready but the same results still For my site now I have switched to jQuery UI instead Have no one had this problem before seriously It s ridiculous Hi Pupetmup I ve tried your basic demo again I m sorry but still no change I can t see the date class being applied anywhere where it shouldn t be i e it is only on the input field and in the JS call to DateInput As a small thought though I know there are problems with the custom download version of DateInput have you tried using one of the CDN links I ve also looked at the JSFiddle set up from above a little more closely I see that you are referencing the dateInput directly from Github I suspect this version is not affected by this issue hence why we can t replicate it As a start try using script src http cdn jquerytools org 1 2 6 form jquery tools min js script as your CDN link this should reduce the amount of excess code that has to be loaded Another idea I have been experimenting with recompressing the original DateInput sources into minified files using Google s Closure Compiler as is done on this site this seems to be working better at least for me If you want I can send you a copy of what I have to see if this works any better for you Having the same issue Though on a ColdFusion set up It is something with that line date dateinput Not sure exactly the reason behind it but temporarily commented out that line Of course that disables it Hi regal2157 Do you have a link we can see where it shows the issue for you please Unfortunately no This is happening on an internal admin tool for a company Wish I could provide a link Hi regal2157 It s going to be very difficult if not near impossible to help diagnose the issue if we can t see the code is there not any way you could knock up an example that shows the same issue for us please If possible please put do it as a JSFiddle it really would help if we could at least have something Tried to save the page but it wasn t duplicating as just a html file Saved page via browser Luckily I was able to debug it down to the level that the selector is the issue Changing the selector from date dateinput to input type date dateinput seemed to fix my instance of this issue Hopefully the same will fix puppetmup s issue I m a little surprised the former should still work Did you put type date within your input statements Pages without inputs would still explode with this issue Pages with inputs would have the type date inside the element Unfortunately I can only surmise guess as to what might be going wrong it really would help if I can see something an example if not a copy of the original code it is going to be impossible to tell otherwise Please put together a code example preferrably in JSFiddle I m not going to be able to help you unless I can see something in action The problem is JSFiddle renders as a HTML engine My problem is in ASP NET that s where it doesn t work Anyhow I ve given up on this issue and switched to jQuery UI instead ASP NET eventually writes to HTML so that isn t the problem There is probably just some conflicting code Either way I m closing this since you already switched Yeah ASP NET always runs a few client scripts on its own I guess that s what s causing the

validation would fail with the error of Please enter a numeric value I m not sure what you meant by it doesn t do anything But I have updated the javascript code to display an alert when validation is successful Hi Your original code didn t show any message at all with or without the alert I ve just tried your updated code in FF unfortunately I still can t replicate your issue Which browser were you using I can replicate the issue on Opera 11 52 Safari 5 1 2 Chrome 15 0 874 121 on Mac OS X 10 7 2 Apparently Firefox doesn t have the issue I m not sure if it s because Firefox doesn t support the input type of number Ah ok I can now replicate it in Chrome 15 but still can t replicate it in Safari 5 The input type of number is a HTML5 tag AFAIK I believe this is supported by any HTML5 compatible browser so am not sure if this is the issue Also I m struggling to see where this could apply in real life as it seems a very extreme example I m not sure if Tero ever envisaged that this number of decimal places would be used I would be intrigued to find out how a number with this number of decimal places could be used in a real site These tools were intended to be used in a normal website environment and not as an online application any ideas I am in fact using this in a web application where a user is to input a number in a field In one of the field the user is asked for a very small fraction Ah ok I may need to stand corrected on one of my previous comments I think you may be right FF may not yet support the number attribute for input under HTML5 However the number attribute used here is specified in the code for Scrollable although I can t see any code yet that I could identify as controlling the number of decimal places involved I have also seen things that suggest this may actually be a browser bug or issue or that it could be down to the regional settings on a PC that is controlling the number of decimal places Are you able to try the same browsers on other PCs to see if this produces consistent results at all On Windows 7 Firefox Safari and IE do not have this issue But of course Firefox and IE also don t support input type number The reason I think it might have something to do with type number is that if I change type number to type text the number works correctly and the min max validation also works Hi I did read something that kinda follows the same principle although it was relating to the step attribute not the basic number format I suspect that needing to use any here is more likely to be a limitation of the HTML5 spec for number and less so because of Tools inability to handle this number of places in a floating decimal Anyone else have any comments on this or can confirm Hi bearbo In the hope you are still watching this I ve had another chance to look at this in detail I now have something that I believe works much better than my previous example Give this a try DOCTYPE html html head title jQuery Tools

calendar when I clicked on the input box #my_calendar is an image that when clicked I wanted to show the calendar as well Using your suggested fix the previous behavior continues When I click on the image the calendar does not show up No worries I think you need to have a look at your selectors again The selectors you have in use at present are not on your images but on the input boxes hence why I gave you a modified excerpt of code based on this What happens if you click inside the inputbox that has the click event listener bound to it Does that at least work These are not jQuery Tools event listeners but jQuery ones jQuery Tools actually adds 2 3 extra ones I would suggest adding IDs to your img tags then altering each of the calls or at least the click one to be bound to the image ID not the inputbox ID I updated this per your changes http jsfiddle net khanh ma3ks #calender_input this is the input on the top #calendar_input this is in the input on the bottom #my_calendar this is the image on the top #my_calendar2 this is the image on the bototm The top is listening for #my_calendar trigger click function api show This does not work clicking on the image does not do anything and this is what the bottom input is listening on var api2 #calendar_input2 data dateinput #my_calendar2 hover function api2 show And the Calendar does indeed show up when I hover Replacing hover with click does not result in functional code Am I still doing this wrong And If I am I do apologize Alright thanks In the latest version the selectors #my_calendar #my_calendar2 should be bound to the images Alright I found the issue here The calendar actually does show The problem is that after the calendar is shown another event handler for the click event is executed That event handler is this one https github com jquerytools jquerytools blob dev src dateinput dateinput js#L387 394 Because the trigger element is outside of the dateinput itself it will then hide the calendar At the moment there are only two solutions I can think of One is to prevent the second event from firing by calling stopPropagation like so http jsfiddle net duclet J7PQR That isn t ideal since IE tends to fire events in different order and calling stopPropagation is not a good practice because it can affect other scripts Another option is to delay the opening call with window setTimeout http jsfiddle net duclet J7PQR 1 There is probably a better solution for this somewhere but I ll need to dig into the code further to be sure I ll take a look at this some more when I have the time Hi duclet Thanks for the temporary fix I had a feeling it was something like that since hover was working but click was not I do appreciate it Thanks duclet I was going insane looking at this one and couldn t figure out what was going on This does raise an important question though the click effect is a standard jQuery one which I think should be made available for people to use in conjunction with Tools in the same way that khanh was trying to use hover admittedly only as part of the tests Is there any way we can rewrite this part of the functionality so that it is not reliant on click but can achieve the same effect This would make the code more powerful by removing the need to use it internally and making an additional event listener available for general use I m not sure how it can be done at the moment There is probably something that can be done with the trigger option though but I ll need to look more into it Though work is so busy lately that I m falling behind so I probably won t be able to get into this for a couple of

2930616,630,2012-01-23T03:56:15Z,"Overlay mask does not prevent keyboard interaction with underlying elements","It is my understanding that modal dialogs should prevent all interaction with their parent document When using the jQuery Tools Overlay combined with the Mask feature it is impossible to interact with underlying elements using the mouse but perfectly possible to tab to underlying links and form elements using the keyboard I discovered this with jQuery 1 7 1 and jQuery Tools 1 2 4 but the effect can currently be reproduced from the modal dialog demo on the website http flowplayer org tools demos overlay modal dialog html To reproduce 1 load the demo site 2 click one of the buttons in the demo the overlay will load and mask the underlying page 3 press the tab key to navigate to links on the underlying page 4 in Firefox and Chrome the link targets are displayed at the bottom of the document follow a link by pressing the enter key This works for element that can be tabbed to","The SimpleModal jQuery plugin by Eric Martin http www ericmmartin com projects simplemodal uses the following solution The modal dialog traps keydown events In the event the tab key is

4 and jQuery 1 7 1 were used although it can be replicated with the current release and jQuery 1 6 4 does Tools 1 2 5 give the same result I m keen to see if this has ever been part of standard functionality in the past or has 1 2 6 introduced a change from 1 2 5 that stopped this 2 I used to use the Overlay plugin by Lokesh Dhakar http lokeshdhakar com projects lightbox2 a fair amount if you try the same experiment that ecellingsworth mentions above you will still be able to tab through individual elements with the overlay active Blocking out everyone s access to do this may not suit some people if we implement this then I think it should be made as an optional switch One thing to point out though Tero never intended Overlay to be treated in the same way as other overlays indeed I know that he has talked about this within the forums in the past on several occasions I think this was something to do with the capabilities of Overlay which were different to that of a standard overlay this I am trying to get clarified I m not sure if it will have any bearing on this or not if I can confirm I will post here The other thing to think about is that would we want to implement the same functionality for the standard overlay which will most likely _not_ have a mask in place or do we implement this only on the overlay apple effect and not on the standard overlay effect Is there any possibility that this could even be written as part of an effect that can be assigned to Overlay in the same way you might assign an effect to Scrollable This means that the core code wouldn t increase in size we wouldn t need to include a switch to enable or disable it but could add in a new effect that combined say the apple effect with this new switch I m open to ideas on this anyone else have any suggestions For my two cents if it turns out that this was never an intended function of the overlay tool then it simply needs to be added to the documentation And the modal window demo should probably be re titled and reworked to be less misleading For example dialog texts such as You can only interact with elements that are inside this dialog need to be changed I would consider however that enough developers are looking for a replacement for the standard alert and confirm dialogs that it would worthwhile adding this as a feature in some way perhaps with a modal option which prevents interaction with elements outside of the overlay This might be doable with or without a mask I suppose you should ask yourself in as many times as you ve used the overlay tool in how many of those cases did you intend to restrict users to the elements on the overlay Edit I forgot to thank you guys for looking into this Active development is refreshing and

very difficult to narrow it down when using the compressed version of the JS code for Tools Is there any chance you could please link directly to the Overlay code in Github There is a shed load of

jquerytools master src overlay overlay js and https raw github com jquerytools jquerytools master src overlay overlay apple js This will help narrow down where the fault is On a different note FYI we will be moving to support for jQuery 1 7 x for the next release of Tools the live event handler is deprecated from jQuery 1 7 x If we made any changes it will be to the next release of Tools at least for the moment it may be worth adapting your code to see if this is still an issue in jQuery Tools 1 2 7 and jQuery 1 71 Here s the updated code http jsfiddle net Dq925 1 The debugger shows an error

for Tools that can use jQuery 1 7 1 although it is still dev at present check out the Github area for 1 2 7 At present I believe the next intended release is due out in March this year although this is not yet 100 confirmed It may be worth trying the dev version with JQuery 1 7 1 to see if at least it works with on I am also hearing that the current release 1 2 6 seems to work OK with jQuery 1 7 1 too I will check out your updated JS Fiddle and advise I have seen a possible config issue with your demo with regards to the mask attribute I am not sure this is correctly configured I think you may meant to have used something like this mask color #ebecff loadSpeed 200 opacity 0 9 please change the values as desired I m also a little puzzled by your code as I am reading it it appears to try to call Overlay twice once when you call the this variable and again when you call clickLink load Trouble is I think Overlay is treating the load method as an API instance of Overlay even though you ve not put in a initiating call to its API for it This would need something like this var api img rel data overlay before you can then use load I have updated the code again to change the mask http jsfiddle net Dq925 2 It still doesn t work in IE8 7 the same error thrown I have called the Overlay twice because if its only once the overlay won t open in first click There s an existing discussion here http flowplayer org forum 8 40110 and http flowplayer org tools forum 40 21252 Can you show me a full code to initiate that load API Honestly I was expecting to have an Overlay with just this img rel live click function this overlay return false Absolutely this should be all you need to do Let me work on a demo and I will post here what I find Hi OxyFuse I ve been doing some testing whilst I am still working on a final demo I think I can already see one issue Overlay at it s very basic level requires two elements to work properly a trigger and a div containing the overlay content At present I can only see a trigger showing in your code but can t see any code that would constitute the overlay content I m guessing that you actually only need a basic overlay with mask but for the overlay to contain the Youtube video Is this what you have in mind Hi alibby Thanks for looking more into this Both the trigger and the b div b containing the content to be overlay are dynamically created by the Embedly plugin first As you can see the HTML code the list has anchor elements When the Embedly plugin runs it will replace the anchor elements with a thumbnail and video resulting in a code like this ul id galleryThumb li id 1 class list img class embedly rel #vidPreview 1 src http i4 ytimg com vi wTcz etqwKg hqdefault jpg div id vidPreview 1 class vidPreview iframe_VIDEO_HERE div li li id 2 class list img class embedly rel #vidPreview 2 src http i3 ytimg com vi zVNTdWbVBgc hqdefault jpg div id vidPreview 2 class vidPreview iframe_VIDEO_HERE div li ul The trigger that was dynamically created was img class embedly rel #vidPreview N and the b div b containing the overlay content that was dynamically created was div id vidPreview N But I think the problem in IE was not the b div b containing the overlay content but the trigger itself It seems that it cannot find the dynamically created trigger element Though this is the case for now in Embedly I can foresee the same problem later on when dealing with PHP and AJAX just like this b http flowplayer org tools forum 40 21252 b Hi OxyFuse Ah OK this makes better sense now I guess I wasn t reading the code properly I ve seen the issue of various Tools not automatically creating an instance of themselves i e Overlay Scrollable etc when items are generated dynamically I think one trick I ve seen used is that if you create the instance of that tool first i e in this case Overlay you can then create the dynamically generated elements and follow that up by a second call to initialise Overlay Sounds a bit wierd I know but it s because most tools are not set to pick up dynamically generated elements to do so I suspect might involve a large rewrite of each code I could be wrong though Hi OxyFuse Did the above trick help at all Closing due to lack of activity please reopen if this is still an issue I think that s what I m doing in the original code calling twice the Overlay If you have another way of doing it please let me know I will have a look I am not familiar with Embedly so it may take a little while before I get anything I ve been looking I can get it working in IE9 but get the same Error Exception thrown and not caught but on line 96 in Overlay js This suggests to me that something in IE7 8 isn t able to find the Overlay properly I will dig more into this Closing due to lack of

you do a soft or hard refresh from the server Marking this as a bug for investigation Please take a look at http jsfiddle net B5fx9 Note I couldn t emulate a refresh on jsfiddle so I ve pre set the value instead The end result should be the same Hi ukch Thanks for this now that I have seen your code I am now not so sure if this is actually a bug as such and whether you actually have the right config in place To confirm your expectation is that you want an instance of DateInput to show on screen with a predetermined format shown correct As soon as you click on the drop down to select another date it should show an updated date in the inputbox using the right formatting This is definitely a bug My expectation is that whatever format DateInput puts in the box should also be readable by DateInput Apologies if that isn t clear from the JSFiddle like I said I can t simulate the page refresh in JSFiddle so I set an initial value instead which yields the same result I m still not convinced when I ran your demo in JSFiddle I got NaN showing even without doing any refresh at all Playing around with the DateInput JS call makes me think that the format you ve used is not actually valid I will see if I can put together a demo of how I would expect to use DateInput I think the format you have there at the moment is being calculated by DateInput as part of working out what the format should be rendered as naturally the letters used are ones you can t subtract hence why you are getting NaN showing If you put spaces in between the hyphens it then works perfectly I am not sure that the code is set up to expect hyphens as valid separators I would suggest that if this is the case then this could be something that needs to be added as a feature request Let me investigate this further I will come back to you and confirm for sure EDIT I ve just seen something on another email which makes me more sure I need to investigate further ukch I ve done some more testing I think this

format is sent to the server change function var isoDate this getValue yyyy mm dd #backendValue val isoDate script Whilst I absolutely agree with you that the format should be as you want DateInput to use I think the design is such that you may have to include 2 3 extra lines of code in order to achieve the result you need AFAICS the format attribute is not a standard HTML5 one but specific to Tools this means that it may not quite follow the same route as you might otherwise expect from a standard HTML5 object The library was written at a time when HTML5 was still very new and items such as this were either added because the then HTML5 spec didn t include it by default or Tero wanted to extend existing functionality Could you please give the above a try and confirm if it now produces the same result as you are expecting to see If so I am hoping that you can still use the format attribute but change it to whatever format you want to see the response rendered as the change event method is the crucial one which gets the date back ready to render it in the desired format The above code doesn t seem to make any difference I think the Fiddle I posted earlier may have just confused you as to what the actual issue is here I have updated it to remove the default value To reproduce the issue Using Firefox open the updated JSFiddle at http jsfiddle net B5fx9 2 this may work on other browsers depending on what sort of refresh they do by default Pick a date from the bottom right cell Reload only the bottom right frame in Firefox do right click This Frame Reload Frame Click the input again You should notice that the calendar month and year have been replaced with undefined NaN and all the days have been replaced with NaN Hi Thanks for this as it so happens I wasn t confused over what the issue was at all I was able to replicate it very easily The steps above though did help to confirm that I was getting the same result Let me recheck the code as I am little surprised it didn t seem to work for you it actually came from the Tools site I will come back to you as soon as I have an answer Okay I m still investigating but I have seen one thing you re loading 2 versions of jQuery which is known to cause conflicts Can you please change your CDN link so where you see full in the URL you have all instead This will load Tools without JQuery which you already have loaded separately EDIT I ve just retried my demo again it seems to show DateInput absolutely fine each time I refresh Admittedly I am doing this in a full browser window and not in the confines of JSFiddle This would seem to indicate that the code is good so I don t know if JSFiddle is doing something or if the 2 versions of jQuery you have loaded in your demo is causing a conflict issue The problem still persists when substituting full for all in the URL What do you mean when you say you are doing this in a full browser window and not in the confines of JSFiddle Do you mean you are reloading the entire JSFiddle frameset Because that definitely won t reproduce the issue If you are having problems reproducing the issue I suggest you follow my above steps to the letter Hi ukch I ve followed your demo to the letter reproducing it is not a problem what I am trying to do is eliminate any possible cause of conflict or issue here I ve run your demo and a very similar copy of mine in a plain browser window both work perfectly fine When I run your demo in JSFiddle that is when I get the issue so I am a little confused as to the reason for wanting this to work in JSFiddle when it is clear the code itself works fine The reason I suggested trying the change to your CDN link is that if you load 2 versions of jQuery it is known to cause a conflict I wanted to rule out any possibility that this was causing the problem there is also no need to load 2 versions of jQuery when one will do fine With regards to operating it in a plain browser window and not in JSFiddle I was trying to establish if JSFiddle may have had any impact on the demo I ran your demo both inside and out of JSFiddle whilst it showed the issue in JSFiddle it _didn t_ show it in a plain browser window This makes me think that potentially there is something that JSFiddle is trying to do here I don t know what I am trying to eliminate any possible avenue When you run your demo in a _plain_ browser window do you get the same result I also have a copy of DateInput that I compressed using Google Closure I can email this to you to see if this helps As I was getting nowhere with this I ve been looking at this with duclet who is helping me with the next release of Tools duclet has been able to ascertain that there is something in Firefox that is prefilling the values in all input statements with the previous values when you reload a page this seems to be causing the problem Based on this I ve done some digging this seems to be a known quirk with FF it seems that adding autocomplete off to the input statements makes it work properly I ve tried it on your JSFiddle demo and it seems to work for me Could you please try this and let me know if it works OK I m still working on whether this should be added to the DateInput source code something in me says yes but something also says we need to test this with a mix of DateInputs and normal text boxes to see what if any impact this may have Yes from my understanding of Firefox that is the root of the problem Unfortunately adding autocomplete off does not seem to have fixed the issue for me see the updated http jsfiddle net B5fx9 4 Hi Mmm this is odd this seemed to fix it fine for me Let me take another look Hehe this is weird it is still working for me Can you please update your JSFiddle with this input type date autocomplete off please My latest JSFiddle is updated Make sure you click the most recent link ie my comment of 2 days ago as JSFiddle does versioning meaning the older links will link to older versions Seems like you had a typo in your fiddle You forgot the symbol in autocomplete off I have updated it so try it now http jsfiddle net B5fx9 5 Hi ukch Did the above work for you I believe this is now resolved please reopen if this is not the case Apologies for the typo Yes the updated fiddle works for me I can t reopen this issue so I ve started #686 to track documenting this

Validator can still be used to check inputs that don t necessarily have a form element present check out the Validating inputs without a form section here http flowplayer org tools validator index html I d be interested in hearing how you get on with this In the example I provided using form validator doesn t work Digging the source I notice that Validator when applied to a form element selects only input s descendant that form element I know that Validator can be used to check input s not belonging to a form but it would be useful to extend Validator to select input s with the form attribute and bind their validation to that form s submit event Hi heruan Mmm I m personally not sure how that would work within Validator s base code for validating form elements In some respects this will start to blur the dividing line between using one method to validate normal form elements and those that sit outside of any form is there a reason for not wanting to use the checkValidity method that is already available and which should work here I think the reason is semantical An input element belongs to a form not only when it s a descendant of the form element but also when it has the form attribute equal to the form s id So Validator when applied to a form element should select those input s too On the other side checkValidity should be used only on input s not belonging to any form It should be a matter of a couple of lines I ll try to fire a pull request if you d like to give it a try Thanks yes please let s at least give it a try in terms of coding a fix so I can then

concerning about this Here s the jsFiddle http jsfiddle net MxyFF duc tri le could you please let me know what you think on this Interesting Though the case where this actually happens from the looks of it is extremely small and I don t feel like slowing down the selector is worth it Even the documentation states that this case is generally for nested forms only and even then again it would be malformed HTML I do like this functionality though and would certainly see it as being a new feature But I would go along the lines of adding it as an option so as to prevent the selector engine being used too much Thank you for taking this into account Note that placing form elements outside the form tag still produces valid HTML5 I agree that the global selector slows down the execution of the script although it would be triggered only when an id is specified BTW adding an option to enable sounds really great I would agree with duclet I m very much of the view that the source code should be clean semantically correct where possible and that speed should not be sacrificed unless necessary Whilst I agree that this would produce valid HTML5 code I m not sure what benefit this would serve in terms of using it in a production environment I suspect this may just be my ignorance so I am keen to learn if anyone wants to clarify It doesn t feel right adding in something that could produce malformed code OK I know HTML5 might validate as being OK but it wouldn t be clean In the meantime I think as a starting point it would be good to see if this could be added as an additional function but in the same way that you might add a custom validator function I ve not seen lots of demand for this yet so I think it may be worth at least seeing if an example could be produced that fits in with the base code We can then monitor demand for this and reconsider at a later date if circumstances the HTML5 standard demand changes What about using the form property elements It would be cleaner

characters on input and click on submit again error message turn to chracters when i entered in input But it s working on offical site examples so I decided to download that package from site source and it fixed error message chaos I was happy to do that until another bug come up I bind a function onSuccess event There was no problem with this But when I clicked on submit button of empty form Error messages showes up And after when i enter some characters in any input onSuccess event triggered I hope its clear","Hi firatagdas Could I please ask a small favour It would really help if you could please copy this example into something like JSFiddle www jsfiddle net I think where we can see this in action I can not see anything immediately obviously wrong with the code which suggests that there may be an issue with the downloaded version of Validator I have seen some issues with the custom downloads so if you can put this into a JSFiddle then we can confirm for sure I think there s something wrong with the Validator download It won t work if you download it but it s fine if you just link to the CDN http cdn jquerytools org 1 2 6 all jquery tools min js Hi OxyFuse There s a known issue with the Validator download the custom download doesn t work properly at present I ve tested another version that has been minimised from source which seems to work better if you would like a copy please email me at alex_libby_at_ntlworld_dot_com no underscores Alternatively you can always save a copy of the CDN link code particularly if you want to host a copy of the files locally on your server Hi This is the problem of custom download that you ve already know http jsfiddle net H3VZX 2 Please do the following steps Click the submit button directly not enter any input and see the errors After the first step enter some input and than click the submit button again See the errors This is second error that i mentioned earlier http jsfiddle net uAVFa Steps Open your developer console Click the submit button not enter any input Enter some input When do that watch the developer console and see the error Thanks for your help Hi firatagdas Thanks for this it confirms what I suspected the custom download of Validator is broken If you would like a replacement version please email me your details to alex_libby_at_ntlworld_dot_com and I can send you a replacement file which I have been testing it s a recompile of the original source Alternatively you can save a copy of the file being used in the CDN links whichever you prefer Thanks but the second bug still exists on cdn if you can check the jsfiddle second link i use cdn link for show you onSuccess event broken with both conditions Hi I ve just tried both versions I can t get the second link to throw any errors at all It shows the success trigger fine and the validator works as I would expect it I suspect the onSuccess event is not actually broken per se but the custom download is not good and that this may be having the knock on effect you have seen on the first one It may help if you can provide a screenshot of what you can see you can email it to my address given earlier on this issue log hope this helps http www screencast com t LDjpjwhsk1j4 Hi Thanks for this the onSuccess functionality is not broken the functionality you are seeing is as described After the validation if one or more fields are valid The second argument is a jQuery object containing all fields that passed the validation it is designed to kick in if one or more of the fields validate correctly during validation The reason for this is that you can use the onSuccess method to show a visual indicator if a field correctly validates such as putting a green tick or red cross against a field that has or has not validated correctly Well In that case how can i use ajax after a form validation success There is no unique parameter between single input validation and whole form validation in e Event Parameter that i know If I could use event parameter like if e validationElement form or if e validationElement input that would be very helpfull Or is it already there S Not 100 sure but I think there is have you tried using the isDefaultPrevented event handler Check out the JSON code under Server side integration which shows the principles of how to use it at http flowplayer org tools validator index html I m assuming that you are trying to catch when all of the fields are successfully validated so that you can then move onto the next stage of your code correct I just tried the isDefaultPrevented but no luck You can see here http jsfiddle net uAVFa 1 Yeah Isn t it that an innocent and basic need No worries I am right in saying though that you need that trigger point to catch when all of the fields are successfully validated correct If so let me do som digging I will let you know if I find anything On 04 02 2012 18 05 firatagdas wrote I just tried the isDefaultPrevented but no luck You can see

https github com jquerytools jquerytools issues 674#issuecomment 4176024 1 from me too as an author on a new book for jQuery Tools I would say that yes CDN links are recommended although it is entirely up to you to use whichever method you prefer Tero makes the CDN links available for anyone who wants to use them although I know that if you only want a small part of the library then it is often better to use a customised download I know that the CDN links have caused problems in the past I will be speaking to Tero about this as I do share your pain Hector thank you very much for the tip that s a neat technique that I will be using in future I must say I m surprised that the Tools website is still broken given that they don t even have to go digging for an alternate source for the file It s still down from here Is jQuery Tools dead 40odd hours with no response from a member of the team Can t post to the forums I know Tero has been busy with a family but if we can t rely on the future of this code it s gotta be given to someone else or forked It seems the domain was updated and that took a while to propagate and now the CDN link is returning a 301 to simplecdn maxcdn com which never loads I like many others have sites that rely on this library and they are all down because of this If this was a human made change why no warning No blog post just gone Very frustrated whiteatom Hi guys I ve been in contact with maxcdn com too and they said their servers was looking okay but it can be some problem in the config anyways I m still waiting for response from the SysOps at maxcdn com and they will be able to give more details if not Tero gets it fixed in the meanwhile What I did was to go to http jquerytools flowplayer netdna cdn com 1 2 6 form jquery tools min js etc because it was the one I needed Downloaded the file and loaded it to my own CDN network same method as the HTML5 Boilerplate does with jQuery Hopefully it will be fixed soon anyway Best regards Lucas R Hi All I had a couple of live websites relying on this code and didnt realise there was a proble til around 16 hours ago when people complained Just goes to show that you should always host all of your own files and never rely on anyone else well maybe google Im presuming jquerytools is owned operated by only one person Is there anyway they could get google or someone more reliable to host the cdn I had another website break recently which relied on access to an external wesite I dont think im going to make this mistake again That s not a bad idea anyone know what s involved in getting jQuery Tools hosted on google s CDN jQuery UI is there and I d say this package is WAY better then jQuery UI and should be just as popular Hi Singy36 and whiteatom Sigy36 MaxCDN which is the hosters of the current file is very reliable The problem now isn t the MaxCDN side of it But anyways whiteatom It will be hard to get it on googles cdn network but cdnjs com is a CDN that host javascript libs you can request it to get added there Best regards Lucas R Hi Lucas Looks like its down to the owner of jquery tools then to sort this problem out and look to getting help maybe if he cannot support it fully by himself I didnt realise jquery tools was a one man band and relied on it for my websites This has totally put me off the use of jquerytools as it doesnt seem reliable enough to used in a live environment Im thinking about redesigning the jquery parts of my website because of this and maybe use the jquery tools from the google CDN and then look at hosting any jquery plugins on my own server I currently use the jquery tools for my tabbed boxes scrolling gallery and overlay popup box features which I do really like Mark Mark This has totally put me off the use of jquerytools I think it is important when thinking about the impact of this issue to distinguish between the code and the distribution system The code is _exactly_ as good as it was last week the problem is only with the CDN distribution I d advise just hosting the jquerytools file yourself this hardly seems like a reason to stop using it altogether Just a thought So it s great that this CDN http jquerytools flowplayer netdna cdn com 1 2 6 all jquery tools min js seems to work but doesn t anyone know how permanent this is takshaka I actually agree with Mark it s not so much about the CDN but 48 hours of down time speaks volumes about the support and man power behind this code Yes the code is as good but they push the CDN on the site so most people use it and then it s unsupported when it s down The best ISP Cable company other utility is useless if no one answers the phone when there are problems just saying whiteastom As you say the code is good Anyone using the CDN including me until this came up has learned a valuable lesson about the advisability of relying on external resources without a sensible fall back and courtesy of Hector up above also learned an excellent technique for minimising disruptions At the end of the day it is down to each individual developer to decide how to handle it I just wanted to point out to Mark that to stop using the code seemed a little unnecessary Hi I understand that the code is good but my problem is with the support or lack of No one so far after 2 days from jquery tools has been in touch with anyone to let them know what is happening I m thinking even if I host jquery tools myself what happens if sometime in the future some changes are made to jquery which then breaks my jquerytools plugins If there is no support I will be left to try and resolve the problems myself Mark Mark If you host jquery yourself too nothing can break it People please relax download the file host it locally Problem solved You should never be relying solely on an outside source for the hosting That is just bad practice Using the CDN will help with speed but you should always have a backup just in case things do go down I know Tero tries to provide the CDN as a good resource for the community to use but he doesn t guarantee its full availability all the time either People who help the project also don t get paid or spend their entire day working on the project Please calm down and not get too hasty here It isn t that hard to download the file down via github put it on your own site and change the URL to your local copy I agree with duclet Hi everyone I ve been in touch with MaxCDN itself about this issue here is the response There is a problem with a free site called JQueryTools It is a free JS tool set which is our client Their origin is having an issue and it is causing other users to complain The issue is with the JQueryTools origin We have informed them of this and they are working on it But for a quick fix you can download the file from the url below instead of the file that is served from the cdn http cdn origin flowplayer org 1 2 6 form jquery tools min js Also I want to say thanks to Tero for providing jQuery tools and the access to the CDN network Also he s the creator of headJS which solves lots of problems anyway Oh even his own site is still down that worries me It is a good library but maybe the project is to big for a one man band If there was a donate button on his website i would happily donate a percentage when doing commercial projects The money of course should be used to hire support maintainance Hi Optiki I ll get jquery tools pushed to the cdnjs com cdn later this week if possible Best regards Lucas R Hi Zerpex Great ideat but someone beat you to it The CDN is back Yeah Daniel Hi All As a volunteer admin coordinator for jQuery Tools I would have to agree with duclet hopefully I can address some of the comments raised here Tero has for some time now wanted jQuery Tools to be run as a community project where people help each other by providing support fixes and patches for the source code He will still maintain the direction of the library and is responsible for new major releases but has taken a back foot in terms of day to day support I try to help maintain some form of sense and order in the forums as well as help co ordinate bug fixing for next releases of Tools which incidentally we are pushing for 1 2 7 to be out very soon I can t do this without the huge help of duclet as well as all of you guys who have provided bug fixes over the last year or so Duclet and zerpex have a point though just because a CDN link goes down once in a while it should not be a reason to completely drop using the Tools library Tero provides the links for the benefit of the community but as Duclet says he doesn t guarantee their availability I think this is only fair given that this is a completely open source project from which Tero doesn t make any money as far as I am aware The software is always available via the Github area whilst it may not be possible to link to it using IE a bug from Github IE not Tools you can always download the library at will and link to it from within your own projects The CDN links use Google Closure to minimize the code this is very easy to use @zerpex thanks for the suggestion of cdnjs com I ve actually emailed Tero to suggest that an alternative link would be a good idea and suggested that he look to do something I will let you know what he says @singy36 jQuery Tools doesn t have a commercial support channel as is otherwise available for Flowplayer one of Tero s other projects Support for Tools is provided entirely through the Github area and forums by myself and others who do it on a purely voluntary basis Whilst this means we can t always respond as quickly as we would like after all we all have day jobs I for one am happy to help wherever I can as I know others do as well Please continue to raise any issue within Github I keep an overall eye on what happens within the Github area this includes prioritising fixes for future versions of Tools You and anyone else interested are more than welcome to download the dev versions of Tools which are updated periodically as soon as issues are fixed or patches committed to code This means that you can identify in a dev environment if the code still works OK for you or if it breaks your existing setup you can link to it directly from your own dev area if you wish although I have found that IE9 doesn t seem to like doing this I think this is an issue with Github IE9 and not Tools The license is set so that you can do what you like with the Tools there are no limits Indeed if you find an issue and or provide a fix for one I am happy to take a look at it and either work on a fix or commit one to source if it is a suitable fix In the meantime I will continue to monitor things and keep Tero appraised if there are any further issues with the CDN links please continue to log them here in the usual manner Thanks for your ongoing support Alex Hi Alex Thanks for your comments would you be able to look in to getting jquery tools hosted on googles cdn Thanks Hi singy36 You re welcome I ve already emailed Tero to suggest doing something as owner of the project he should take the lead but I am happy to suggest doing something Let me see what he comes back with if he is agreeable to it I will suggest looking at Google s CDN or even cdnjs com which has been suggested in this issue history The missing UI library for the web teehee I m glad to see the cdn working again Thanks to whoever got it working again I have a couple of suggestions 1 The flowplayer org site uses jquerytools extensively which is great for showing what it can do It became somewhat nonfunctional because it was using the cdn It would be great if it used a locally hosted copy of the library instead so the site would continue to work if the cdn is down This would allow people to post messages in the forum if such an event took place again and would allow people to continue to get support info from the site for development purposes I had to stop my work with the library while the cdn was not working because the info I needed was on the site and I could not access it 2 If suggestion number 1 is not implemented some form of being able to communicate with the team that makes it work could be implemented on the site that does NOT depend upon the library This was not the appropriate place for this type of communication but I could find nowhere else to communicate that a problem existed The library is great and I appreciate all the hard work that goes into providing this awesome resource Thanks so much to all that make it happen Oh where is the donate button I m not sure how the rest of the team feels like but I rather not take any donations in terms of money I believe we do most of this stuff because we want the web to be better and or like to code If you would like to donate I suggest maybe you can look at some of the issues that are posted and possibly see if you can help in fixing it I find that to be much more valuable so certainly help this code base to be more community driven I m happy to announce http cdnjs cloudflare com ajax libs jquery tools 1 2 6 jquery tools min js is now on cdnjs com too Best Regards Lucas Well seems like issue has been resolved so I m closing Thanks to all the people who helped and especially to those who helped getting this up on other CDNs Just a note @spil lucasRolff The cloudflare version appears to include the 1 6 4 version of jQuery @benpowell that s correct I even asked them back then to update their version with the non jquery version of it as well But they didn t want to maintain it So I m thinking about hosting it myself anyway Down again http cdn jquerytools

think I can get you part way there based on something that duclet has done for issue 629 DateInput API Call from within a Click Event It seems there is an inherent issue with the API for DateInput not showing properly depending on what event handler you use I ve at least been able to do this #alex bind click function event date dateinput var api datepicker data dateinput event preventDefault event stopPropagation api show I ve also found that you can show the DateInput calendar or at least part of it if you switch the display CSS style from none to block on #calroot this is the base CSS for the calendar The above will open the calendar based on clicking a button what I ve not been able to figure out is how I can call that event handler from your onChange event hander for the dropdown Thanks I will work with it and see what happens and report back I did experiment some with the API call and didn t succeed before but I see pieces here I did not try I have an ID search_pax on that select so tried the following #search_pax bind change function e alert focus dammit date dateinput var api datepicker data dateinput e preventDefault e stopPropagation api show Unfortunately it didn t do the trick I think there is something in the JQTools that disables the dateinput in case of click away In Firefox the click to change the value of the select seems to be counted as a click away oops I left my testing alert please disregard that choice snippet Hehe yes I know what you mean it might help if you can update your JSFiddle with any more recent changes please Any time you hit Save in JSFiddle it should append a revision number on the end Since this snippet didn t work I wasn t sure if it would be helpful in the JSFiddle But I m happy to put it there for experimentation purposes with a

interesting note is going to another browser tab or application and coming back to the browser tab with the datepicker in it DOES pop open the calendar So I experimented with forcing the focus even blurring then focusing again but it didn t work Hi liselatorre I ve spent the last couple of hours looking at this unfortunately nothing I ve tried has worked I will keep looking but it may help to try to understand the reason for needing to force open a dateInput based on the selection of an item in a select statement Are you able to elaborate please We have a full search form that uses default values in the form fields instead of labels The script advances the cursor after each select and as a field comes into focus the default text is removed When the cursor advances to the date input the default text goes blank BUT the calendar doesn t open and the user cannot enter any text making the user experience a little awkward You can see it in action on www limos com HI liselatorre I ve just tried your site this evening in FF10 the dateInput now seems to be opening automatically when I tab through from the previous field Have you done anything to fix it or change the code since the last post above Tabbing and clicking are always fine its just the cursor advance focus that does not trigger the calendar Ah of course sorry it s been a long day I m going to seek assistance on this as I am not 100 sure I know the answer or if indeed it is possible I will come back to you as soon as I can I greatly appreciate all of your effort We might have to ditch the auto advance of the cursor I ve asked duclet to help on this he has been helping me with bug fixing for the next release of Tools which will be 1 2 7 Hopefully we will be able to have an initial answer within the next couple of

works great in JS Fiddle When I plug it into our app I get an error type indexOf is not a function referencing our local version of jQuery Is there a work around or does this mean we need to update jQuery to get this fix to work setTimeout is a great idea I am going to monkey around in that direction to see what I come up with Hi liselatorre You will need to ensure your version of JQuery is on 1 7 1 the 1 2 7 branch won t work properly on an older version I was afraid of that Sounds like I have some selling to do Thanks for the help What version of jQuery are you on now Sorry again I didn t get notification of your post We are on 1 7 Even upgrading to 1 7 1 I am getting indexOf is not a function Hi liselatorre It might help if you can update your original JSFiddle with duclet s code so we can see the same error that you are getting and try to help fix it I ll see if I can reproduce i the error there It seemed to work fine in JS Fiddle but I can t find the conflict as the error message references the jQuery file directly and no other script Oh I ve reproduced it in Dulcet s sample If you continue to change the number of passengers at some point you get the error In the

original posting so the HTML shows properly now you need to use just before and after any blocks of HTML for it to show correctly A better alternative is actually to set up a demo in JSFiddle and post the URL for it here This would be a great help if you could do this please it allows us to see the issue in action and modify your code suggest an answer etc depending on what we find There are some things you can check 1 Which version of Tools are you using 2 When you remove the placeholder attributes set does it then work OK 3 If you put some text into the placeholder attributes does it then start to work I think it would really help if you could please set up a demo in JSfiddle I m not sure there is enough code in your example to determine the cause Hi I tried your suggestions and it still doesn t work properly I have created a jsfiddle which reproduces the issue Note I m using the latest version 1 2 6 of JQuery tools I m using the CDN but same error happens if I use local version http jsfiddle net sfuptown KFzYH 5 User Case #1 1 Run fiddle 2 With both fields blank submit the form 3 Notice the errors show for mandatory fields 4 Enter a date only skip title field and submit again Notice the message doesn t go away 4 Enter title field and submit and form submits User Case 2 With both fields blank click submit Error messages show Now enter something in title field and notice message goes away Do the same for date field and message does not go away thank you Hi southofmarket Thanks for putting together a JSFiddle this has definitely helped I ve had a look I don t think date validation is actually done OOTB with Tool s Validator so you need to create a custom validator for this I ve put together something for you tools validator fn type date function el value return 0 9 4 0 1 9 1 012 0 1 9 1 0 9 2 0 9 3 01 test value true Invalid date as an example this should validate if you use the format 2012 10 21 yyyy mm dd Please feel free to modify the string above to suit your own needs Thank you for the quick response I appreciate it However the issue is not with the proper date it is with a required field I just entered your function and get the same behavior After I enter a date and submit the error message continues to treat it as a required field rather than an invalid date I enter the date and click submit and the message stays there and says please complete the mandatory field It s treating it as if it has no value Shouldn t it change the message to Invalid Date if the date is invalid But either way the please complete the mandatory field message should go away and be replaced by the invalid date Am I totally missing something Can you please update your JSFiddle with function above and I will take a look EDIT Just rechecked my original copy of your demo it s still working as I expected with the addition of the function Bear in mind that you can t paste the date in you do need to enter it manually as I think Validator works on the keyup change i e only when entering character by character The problem is with the mobile device It seems to work ok on a desktop browser See updated fiddle http jsfiddle net sfuptown KFzYH 8 However if I use the draft of fiddle on safari with the headers set to iphone the date textbox gets an up and down arrow on its right side I click it up or down and it inserts a date Then when I submit it does not say invalid date It keeps the original message for a mandatory field In tracing it with both desktop and mobile safari I noticed the checkValidity method IS being called on the desktop browser and is NOT being called on the mobile browser To reproduce the issue create a file using the code from fiddle and run it in safari with headers to iphone Correction I meant User Agent set to iPhone I entered this date 2012 10 21 click submit and the error message says Please complete this mandatory field For some reason on a mobile device the type date does not work at all Do you think it might have something to do with JQuery Mobile It s as if the event is not bubbling through to the validator I change the errorInputEvent to change when I move off this field the checkValidity should fire but its not When user agent is not set to iphone it does fire Thank you Update I run it in my iphone simulator http electricplum com A free version is available I enter the date you recommend above 2012 10 21 and I cannot submit the form It keeps the invalid date message on the screen The form will not submit even with a valid date There is definitely an issue isolated to mobile devices Works fine on a desktop browser Thank you Mmm not sure I m not yet familiar enough with JQM to be able to say so I will do some research In the meantime though could I please ask if you do me a small favour and switch your custom validator with the main validator call so the custom validator is first I m not sure but it may just be that it has to be run first in order for Validator to pick it up properly Just a hunch it may be nothing BTW I should mention that I think your validator is kick ass and its perfect for the architecture of my site Even though I m using net mvc on the server side I abhor the way they handle validation with all those attributes on data models I much prefer the elegance of your validator However my site must support mobile devices not uncommon support these days with its enormous growth I m super hopeful we can figure out the issue and get it to work properly on mobile browsers Thanks again for your help Sure thing here you go http jsfiddle net sfuptown KFzYH 9 If you email me I can send you a page which you can run on safari with user agent set to iphone or use the aforementioned iphone simulator to reproduce the issue As of this writing this issue is a huge deal breaker for me Thanks Yes http jsfiddle net sfuptown KFzYH 9 From what I can gather the issue is that the checkValidator method is not firing after the date field is changed It does fire for a type text field This would explain why the message stays there and it doesn t let the form submit That method is key and must fire The question is why is it not firing for type date I wonder if it will have the same issue for the other html5 types like url email etc that I haven t tested On Sun Mar 11 2012 at 2 41 PM wrote Hi did you try switching the code around as I suggested Reply to this

delving into uncharted waters a little JQM wasn t out when Tools was written so I don t have any reference t work from here it may work better than using the normal route You still need to have the required required statements in though and naturally will need to adapt it to include the JQM code in it The required attribute is the issue If I include it it won t let the form go through Your point about JQM not out when tools was written is a valid one But since it is just js I thought it would work Perhaps I was mistaken JQM growth is exploding so do you have plans to ensure validator works with JQM moving forward As I suspect a huge number of new JQM sites being developed and as it stands there is no good validation out there You could own the space Thanks On Sun Mar 11 2012 at 4 01 PM

github com jquerytools jquerytools issues 695#issuecomment 4443192 Argh it is required in order for Tools validator to work as far as I know most validators will require it It s not actually part of the Tools library as such but a HTML5 requirement You could try just putting required on its own and drop the required part maybe this might work I think the original required required is needed for IE to work I would love to see more support for JQM if possible I m keen to keep this library as small and efficient as possible but if there is something there that we can do without adding too much extra code then I m definitely up for having a look I think your assumption is perfectly valid it is just JS after all given what you ve said about the required attribute it makes me wonder if it isn t actually JQM s apparent inability to use the required statement This said I have seen a validator work with JQM which did use required required so I am not sure this would be the case EDIT Just seen something have you tried using class required in there just in case it might work I have just seen this though https github com jquery jquery mobile issues 3778 it talks about needing required required for validating radio buttons It sounds suspiciously like JQM is having a problem with this attribute somewhere and that if JQM gets this fixed then Tools will work fine Just to really complicate matters I ve seen a similar issue raised here http stackoverflow com questions 7815951 jquery invalid html 5 form with required select element this suggests the fault is actually with

is a workaround that will work Create a custom attribute and change to type text from type date input id Date name Date placeholder Enter your meal date data date true type text required required Then add custom validator for the new custom attributte tools validator fn data date function input value return 1 9 0 1 9 1 0 2 0 9 0 2 0 9 3 0 1 0 9 0 9 1 2 0 9 0 9 0 9 test value true Invalid date This works Downside is one loses the native implementation of the date control on the browser The user must enter the date the old fashioned way by using the keyboard If acceptable then this actually works nicely Because its a type text the required works great With the custom attribute the validator will test for a valid date When a valid date is entered the error message does go away check it out on

this instance would it make better sense to have a look at the DateInput functionality from within Tools You can control the format of how it shows the date on screen as the inputbox is not editable there will be no risk of there being an issue with entering invalid dates thereby rendering it unnecessary to have Validator Just a thought it may be nothing but thanks for the thought I tried it but it doesn t render properly on a mobile device It would be my preference to use it on a desktop site On Mon Mar 12 2012 at 12 59 PM wrote Hi southofmarket I ve just had a thought I know we ve come

to text away from date Whilst it does mean that you will lose the ability to show the calendar the option you have there seems perfectly OK to me It s really down to a matter of taste having the type attribute set to text will allow it validate perfectly correctly as it will effectively work on a pattern match rather than a true date If I was being a purist I would probably have preferred using the dateInput option but if it doesn t render then using the alternative of the regex above seems OK to me When you tried using the dateInput option you said it didn t render on screen properly I m keen to understand why are you able to post a screenshot please somewhere If this is a matter of styling then this is largely controlled by CSS which can actually be overriden so it may just be a matter of altering the CSS behind DateInput Hi A couple things since I wrote that I was able to get my ipod to connect to my dev server so I could see it on the real device as opposed to a simulator I must say this is much preferred and really cool to see your mobile site on an actual mobile device Now when I set the type to date JQM nicely uses the ipod native date picker that pops up below It looks and behaves exactly like a native ios app And it provides this amazing functionality out of the box Very cool Not sure I want to give this up just to gain client side validation From a user experience its terrific and what a user expects on a date field within and IOS device JQM will automatically do the same for an android device but I don t currently have one to test with With type text this of course doesn t happen and its a plain old text field and it pops up a keyboard Boring and not expected for a cutting edge mobile app Perception really matters with these apps So its a tradeoff but the beauty of your validation plugin is that I can still perform the validation on the server and return the invalid date Ok trade off as this requires the round trip and on mobile devices with limited bandwidth that is a definite negative Of course the ideal would be if the type date client validation worked the same as type text I would really like to know why it seems to fail on this type And I wonder if it will fail on the other html5 types like url tel etc This would surely limit the usefulness of what I consider a really good validation plugin Are you still going to give this to your contact to further investigate I would think you would want to support JQM as its growing parabolic like apple stock In all seriousness more people will be accessing their favorite sites on mobile browsers than desktops and laptops and its our jobs as developers to give them the very best user experience we can Compare how many mobile devices are sold to laptops desktops Mobile is way outselling the other Think about what Tim Cook said at the apple shareholders meeting recently and the unveiling of the ipad 3 I live in SF where the launch was so a lot of media coverage here

email directly or view it on GitHub https github com jquerytools jquerytools issues 714#issuecomment 4705993 No problem glad the change worked for you Mmm I m not sure I understand your reasoning for thinking that an absent colour means that one wouldn t be set The principle of Expose is that it would always reveal something whilst shading out what s behind Obviously this means that a colour must be set by default otherwise it kinda destroys the whole idea behind Expose I m not sure I can think of any instance where a colour _wouldn t_ be used to hide the background In this instance Tero has set the default colour to be white I think his aim was to also allow you to override the colour being set by including CSS styling In order to do this and to remove any confusion as to which colour is set I think he intended that something should be set in the original color attribute As this is used elsewhere in the code then it will have to be set to something like null in order for it to not then fault with an error I guess the way to think of it is that to avoid using CSS hacks such as important another alternative has to be used can you think of any other way to achieve this given that I think most people would be using a colour of some description by default what intrigues me is the fact that there are two different ways to set the expose background color with the color option and with the css background color declaration perhaps the issue is one of conflict resolution here s one possible way to handle things 1 if expose is called without color set default color this is how jquerytools works now 2 if a css style is set explicitly and a color is set explicitly color option wins 3 if color option is not set but css is perhaps css should win over default color setting allow me to explain the point of view that i came across as i tried to use expose i made a decision early on to style everything through css for consistency s sake so i set the maskId or use the default one either way and proceed to write the style declaration for that selector #exposeMask i test the page and the color is not set because the default color option overrides it it never occurred to me that i should be setting color null to let the css shine through thank you for taking the time to think through this scenario so carefully I do agree that styling should be done via CSS I ll have to take a look at the code to be sure if this is reasonable Hi Guys Mmm I would have to agree that whilst CSS is the right way to style it it does represent something of an architectural dilemma for me which is why I didn t immediately respond The challenge is 1 I believe that Expose is actually used as part of the Overlay functionality on this site I m not sure how but if this is true then whatever is done would have to maintain compatibility working functionality for Overlay 2 Whilst I agree that CSS is how this should be done and which is more in line with the way that Tero is going with this library it does make me unsure how best to implement it in Expose If the existing color attribute is removed outright then it does feel like it would be trying to use a car without a steering wheel as having a background is probably the most important part of the whole piece It would also risk breaking functionality for those who upgrade to newer versions of the Tools library and who already use Expose in a similar capacity again this means we would have to use something that would maintain this backward compatibility @eitansuez You ve made some good comments there although I am not sure I would agree with option 2 purely on the grounds of progressive enhancement If someone viewing a site with Expose running on it and insists on disabling JS within their browser then CSS should override JS so that it doesn t break the site It may not look as good but I suspect that if JS is broken then it may be worse Also it will also depend on where the CSS and JS code is called from is it called from the top inline or bottom of the code Also is the JS called before or after the main code I think that semantic code might suggest that whatever is placed first should be overriden by what comes afterwards I do have a suggestion though perhaps it may be more sense if an attribute was created that acted as a switch This could be set to True to use user defined CSS styles so that whatever is set in the JS in terms of a color is overriden by the CSS style for that element I think part of the current set up where null has to be specified in order to use CSS styles doesn t feel quite right could an alternative be set which didn t require the use of null Whatever happens any CSS solution should not require CSS hacks as originally outlined at the top of this issue log we don t always know if these hacks will be enabled indefinitely and whilst the current solution may not be perfect it does to me achieve the same effect as if a CSS hack had been used but using a cleaner code

ve just tried that code it seems to work fine for me in FF11 There is no need to set the required statement on them I think this is handled in the code automatically although not through the normal route that would otherwise be required for text fields It might help if you get the link above to the form css file in I would also suggest putting any demos into a JSFiddle www jsfiddle net it s easier to modify and play around with Hi alibby251 the radio buttons should be optional unless you add required required to it In this case there is no required attribute yet it is being required and won t submit the form until an option is selected So it is impossible to have optional radio buttons HTML5 by default works properly with regards to optional radio buttons but jQuery Tools Validator breaks this and makes them all required Were you able to have optional radio buttons with that code FYI the form css link is below http jquerytools org media css validator form css Hi thalamus12 Apologies one of my comments was slightly incorrect I meant to say that the code adds the novalidate attribute automatically not the required one Could you please test your demo again and let me know what you see if you use Firebug or similar I ve not had to add the required statements on so I m not sure where the issue is I think the novalidate option I ve just mentioned may be why it appears to be required even though the required attribute is not set this is unfortunately necessary for Validator to work properly Hi alibby I think there s still some confusion I didn t have any problems with novalidate I don t have that in my sample Here s some background In HTML5 the way to make a field mandatory is to set the required required attribute on it For radio buttons you re supposed add that to the first radio button in a group to make it mandatory My issue is that I wan t this group of radio buttons to be _optional_ which it should be by default since I didn t put the required attribute on it If I don t use jQuery Tools Validator it functions properly as an optional radio button group Once I turn jQuery Tools Validator on it forces the radio buttons to be mandatory As you can see my code sample is barebones with no added code to it to mess around with the logic so this looks to be a bug in the validator For some reason it s forcing optional radio buttons to be mandatory plus the Please select an option error message on the radio buttons doesn t go away when you select an option This bug is valid and reproducible see #742 and http jsfiddle net 8GMm8 Hi I need to look into this more I will come back to you as soon as I can Hi I have a similar issue where I have a couple of radio groups all not required After submission the error message only disappears if you select No Please see http jsfiddle net clearmedia vEDse Hi I ran across this issue while searching for information related to a similar problem I was having not specific to jquerytools but seems to only occur when I use jQuery I don t know if this is actually related to the problem described here or not but just in case here is the problem I ran into If you set a radio button as required using jQuery attr required true and then try to set it as _not_ required with attr required false then the radio button will _still_ be required and will prevent the form from submitting even though the required property _claims_ to be false This appears to only be a problem for me in Firefox Here is a jsfiddle that reproduces this behavior http fiddle jshell net TylerRick RPsXQ show I have found a simple solution for this problem change line 261 269 of validation js v fn radio required Please select an option function el var checked false var els name el attr name each function i el if el is checked checked checked true return checked true false 1 I restricted the selector to only required fields 2 Add the checked part to keep the checked state if one and not only the last element of a radio button group is checked Also heruan s first post issue #742 to bind the change V Event to all radiobuttons is a thing to do Since this is an acute problem for me and many other people i would like to know how long does it still take to fix this problem in the real version I would also like to know how i can overwrite the currently wrong behaviour of jQuery Tools without manipulating the original validation js file Hi rabe69 Thanks for your post I ve taken note of your comments on #742 and will action them as soon as possible In the meantime you should be able to add the functionality you need as a custom validator have a look at http www jquerytools org demos validator custom validators html which gives some examples of how to do this Using your code I think you could produce something similar to this note the below is _not_ tested tools validator fn minlength function input value var checked false var els name el attr name each function i el if el is checked checked checked true return checked true false Sorry but this is not working since the wrong validator tools validator fn radio is already defined in jQueryTools who comes from the CDN If I add a new validator tools validator fn radio required the old and wrong one still exists and will fire up the wrong error message Is there a way to kill this wrong part by my own script after jQueryTools was loaded from the CDN And please can you update the labels from this issue because this bug is reproducible Any progress on this or solution I also have the issue where radio buttons which are NOT required are causing the validation to fail 1 just ran into this would be nice to see it fixed Incidentally I note this issue is incorrectly tagged Not Reproducible which might be why it hasn t been picked up to be fixed Yes this is reproducible This is a major issue that shouldn t be too difficult to solve Hi Let me take another look at this I suspect I added the tag Not Reproducible because I was struggling to get the error to reappear not necessarily because the code was at fault I will have a look and post back when I have an answer Hi all I ve been giving this some thought this may just be me missing something but I m not sure if I can think of a suitable use case scenario where radio buttons would be optional I suspect that it may just be me thinking that whilst input boxes could be optional radio buttons were more likely to have been selected as an option because the site owner wanted a mandatory response but wanted some consistency on the type of response received If someone can give me an example of where radio buttons should be mandatory then please do In the meantime I have tested the code fix the addition of required in the code this does indeed seem to fix the issue whilst also making the code required more consistent with what is required to make other form elements obligatory If anyone is able to make a patch to the current dev branch for Validator then I ll get it

code Here s a quick mock up of something for us to work with http jsfiddle net amnesia7 epUUA It has 3 required fields that each display an error message if you just click Save I want to get it to apply focus to the first error field when form submission fails validation Hi Thanks for this apologies for the delay in responding It sounds like you may need something like jQuery s eq function it takes an integer as the value which represents the index of whichever item you want to refer to in a list Have a look at http api jquery com eq does this help Not quite @alibby251 I need to know what trigger I can listen for so that I can focus on the first error field if available I tried using the onFail trigger but that occurs on key press whilst typing in an error field I need a trigger that only occurs when the form is submitted and the form fails validation I ve just been having a play and I think I need to use the onBeforeFail trigger like so javascript bind onBeforeFail function e input input closest form find error first focus which seems to do the job in my jsfiddle http jsfiddle net epUUA 2 Does it sound right to you If so the issue can be closed Hi amnesia7 Apologies I think I mis read what you had wanted Yes this sounds about right one small point though Which version of Tools are you using If it is 1 2 7 then you will need to use jQuery 1 7 1 or higher I think you may need to alter the bind statement to use on instead Ok I think I ve got it now http jsfiddle net epUUA 3 Thanks Mmm I m not sure if you have unfortunately I think the error that comes back for me in Firefox is the browser s validator working and not Tools When I try removing your new code I get a different validation message come back compared to what is showing on http jsfiddle net epUUA 3 To confirm which code try removing the below and check again in JSFiddle on onBeforeFail function e input input closest form find error first focus If you get a different error Please fill in this field instead of this error Please complete this mandatory field it usually means you have a jQuery error somewhere I think the idea is right I would just check through your code carefully You re right there was an error in the onBeforeFail missing a comma and not enough variables in the function so I ve updated it again http jsfiddle net amnesia7 epUUA 6 However now when you click the save button the error messages display correctly but it doesn t focus on the first field It will if you click Save again though It only does it if it already knows that it has failed validation Any ideas Hi amnesia7 I m not sure if I ve got this right but give this a try on onBeforeFail function e el match el closest #myform find input first focus as your onBeforeFail event handler Hi @alibby251 that applies focus to the first input field but it applies focus to the first field in the form whether it has an error or not I d like it to focus on the first field in the form that the error class has been applied to It doesn t seem to like the error selector and I m not sure whether that s because the error class has been added dynamically and requires on to be applied in some way or not @alibby251 I just tried to see if I could use oninvalid but that just give me access to the last input field that was invalid and the error class hadn t been applied at that point so I couldn t use that to get at the first erroneous field either @alibby251 I think I ve nailed it See http jsfiddle net amnesia7 epUUA 7 I ve added a check in the function I have bound to the onFail trigger that checks if e originalEvent type toLowerCase submit so that the focus part only applies if the validation fail is caused by the form being submitted not when a key is pressed like when an erroneous field is being corrected I think e originalEvent is something provided by jquery because e type is actually onFail I ve tried the fiddle above using Opera Firefox and Chrome and it seems to work fine in each If you have access to check it in IE that would be very helpful Beyond that I think this issue can be closed Nice one yep it does indeed look like you ve cracked it I ve tried it in IE9 this

link what I m looking for actually is a non minified version for the application I m doing needs to have all source in non minified form it would be useful if that could be done without doing a github clone","Hi lassikin Apologies it is a little confusing but the download of source is actually referring to what is available in the Github area of the site If you head to https github com jquerytools jquerytools tree master src you will see the page with each part of the library listed are you looking for a specific part of the code If so please let me know and I will dig out the download link for it for you yes it is but it would be much nicer if the download source link actually took you to the github project but I m not looking for a specific piece I m just looking for a download that s compiled into one single js but is not minified why I need it shouldn t matter but it s a case where the projects source is audited and then afterwards ran through a minifier when deploying Hi lassikin I m curious is there any reason you think that pointing to the unminified version is actually better The reason for asking is that minified versions are better to work with in the main as they naturally take less bandwidth this would suit the majority of people who use Tools better This would particularly be the case for those who don t necessarily need to modify the code as such but just need something they can use OOTB For those who prefer to work with the unminified source then there is an option there to download the unminified versions in this way both options should cater for most if not all people In terms of a complete unminified version unfortunately there isn t anything on the Github area that I know of which would help here This said if you can please send me your address to alexlibby_at_ntlworld_dot_com then I can dig out the version I used before minimizing it and getting it posted on this site P S The github link you ve posted relates to an old version of jQuery Tools the latest is now 1 2 7 not 1 2 6 as indicated on that page I assume it is 1 2 7 you were after I wasn t trying to imply that it s better just that it s sometimes necessary So it would be nice to have the download somewhere so as an user I could skip the part of merging it myself from source it wouldn t be a big addition to the options list on the download site but looking at the build xml I suppose it might need work on the server creating the download at least I couldn t figure out how to make closure skip minifying and as to 1 2 7 yes I was looking for the latest version and wrongly assumed that page would have it but it seems the homepage has been moved it would be nice to have a redirect from the old to the new I agree that most of the time users would like just the minified version but there s cases where unminified is nice or necessary to have and where supplying the non minified version as a separate package isn t enough it has to be the actual code in non minified form that gets submitted I agree with lassikin I too would like a non minified version easily available Not because I want to modify it but it helps debugging and figuring out how things work especially for ugh IE testing I also have a server side auto minifier for my js in production so I the minified version offers me no advantage Why not just include the non minified version as on option on the regular download page That would be a lot better than having to manually combine it from githib source I would love an option to download a non minified version straight from the homepage Earlier this week I had to dig some stuff out of github to test an issue I was having which was fine but a non minified version would have saved me a lot of time If it s easy to implement consider this a 1 from me Noted thanks I m trying to get hold of the main developer for some other issues so will add this to the list I ve sent an email to Tero on this so will post back when I hear something from him Any updates on this I also need the unminified version Is there any step in the ant script that I can use to generate that Hi sarwarbhuiyan I m sorry no updates from Tero on this I m afraid I m intrigued though by your question about using ant I m not sure to what you were referring to All of the unminified versions of each part of the library are available from here https github com jquerytools jquerytools tree master src I would use this in the meantime Sorry please ignore the issue with ant I had some error due to not finding ant contrib However that being said running the ant targets does not concat I guess I could write another ant target that concats all the files compressed or uncompressed into one file The reason I needed an uncompressed file is that we have a web framework in which we specify all these third party libs we are using and that framework then minifies and gzips these libs into one file Thanks No worries I fully understand where you are coming from can I make a suggestion please The minified versions of files provided on this site are compressed using Google s Closure Compiler tool https developers google com closure compiler docs gettingstarted_app it may be worth having a look to see if it can compile together a minified or unminified version of the library When I ve used it to release the next version of Tools I normally compress each library on its own then manually add the relevant parts into one file for the CDN links I suspect it may be capable of doing this automatically On 11 11 2012 14 12 Sarwar Bhuiyan wrote

being told by the folks that manage the IronPort system that in the past we have not unblocked sites with this reputation score Normally it is that it is the responsibility of the site owner to clean up their site and that if they do Cisco will raise their reputation I appreciate that the jquerytools tools have real value but many sites that are run by reputable folks have been compromised and acted as the jump point malicious software and other malicious attacks It happened a couple years ago with Iframes from one of my favorite sites The Economist It can happen to anyone Not sure what the next steps are can Data Services contact the site owners and see if they are in a mitigation process with Cisco IronPort and other blacklisting entities I am fairly uncomfortable unblocking this site

you can host it within your own environment Whilst the CDN links have normally been very reliable it is good practice to have a backup copy available in your instance it may actually be preferable to use a local copy if there are going to be issues with your IronPort system Alex Thanks But that s the issue I can t pull the files from the server At least not without violating agency policy We have local copies of 1 2 5 that we use on the sites but I wanted to implement some new features and I rely heavily on the demos documentation to do that That s a big part of why we use your tools because

it Hi wolfmeister I ve had a look at your code I m not sure there s enough there to see what you are trying to do To help with this it is actually better to try using something like JSFiddle www jsfiddle net this allows you to build a working demo that I can see from here and can use to work out what you ve done and figure what needs to be altered to get it to work Could you please see if you can set up a demo in a JSFiddle for me If you struggle let me know and I can try to work out a demo based on the ones from the main jQuery Tools site although it won t necessarily match the styles or content that you may need to have Thanks Hiya http jsfiddle net qg8V4 but the menu links to external pages the enternalpage has the overlay link can i add those linkedpages at the fiddle site also it

full jquery tools min js and hit the big Button it doesnt work so far Hi wolfmeister In between posts I ve had a play this evening I ve managed to put together a demo of sorts which you can see at http jsfiddle net alibby251 VkEnz There are some gotchas though 1 In this block of CSS which comes out of the tabs CSS file you have this css panes div moz border bottom colors none moz border image none moz border left colors none moz border right colors none moz border top colors none background color #DDDDDD border color #666666 border style solid border width 0 1px 1px display none min height 150px padding 15px 20px Running the demo as is with the above block of code will work you can see the results at http jsfiddle net alibby251 VkEnz 1 However it shows up an ugly gray block over the overlay this is being controlled by the background color #DDDDDD entry above Removing this will get rid of the ugly gray box over the overlay but will also clear out any colour from the tabs This may not be an issue for you but something to bear in mind 1 The second gotcha is this removing the ugly gray box above shows 2 border edges still appearing these can be blanked out by removing this line border style solid However this also affects the borders on the tabs as well You may still be able to get around both with judicial use of selectors so that only the relevant elements are being targeted hopefully the above will get you started You can see the result of removing both lines of code at http jsfiddle net alibby251 VkEnz 2 Alex P S The issue with the external pages not appearing This is a security feature in browsers I think its because they must be on the same domain as the source page or that they won t work locally using the file protocol You should be able to get around this by using a local server such as WAMP or MAMP if you re a Mac user or by uploading copies of all of your files to webspace if you have any i see ok cool ok yes i can get it to work too if like you have done i use the overlay link from within a static html div contents on the loading page with the tabs code itself BUT if the tabs menu loads a content page INTO the selected tab the link for the overlay is inside the content page so it loads and the first time you click it fires the overlay but then you move to a new tab with another overlay link and it is dead or step back and the same previously working overlay link is dead The problem is all about loading content pages INTO the tabs the overlay links are on those loaded pages sorry if that wasn t clear btw my fiddle http jsfiddle net qg8V4 6 doesnt work loading the external pages not sure what i did wrong the links are correct the script is loading the tabs ok also if you check my menu fiddle http jsfiddle net qg8V4 7 you ll see some javascript beginning function createRequestObject the tabs is loading the content from that script it was done that way so the pages loading into the tabs from ajax can have links which load into the same tab maybe that s a bad way to use javascript i m a beginner cheers wolfie Hiya mate appreciate the effort sorry your reply made me try some stuff has me thinking in another direction now Is it possible to take these tabs http jquerytools github com demos tabs ajax noeffect htm and modify the code so that the a selected current menu tab if clicked will reload itself again can that be done at the moment if the tab is loaded clicking the menu header does nothing the link is dead if the tab is selected if that CAN be done that fixes the problem i have i think could be an easier solution cheers wolfie oh lol actually it doesnt fully fix it it fixes some of it ok thanks for this cos you are helping me trace the issue ok scrap all that new direction to the problem 2 questions RE this demo http jquerytools github com demos tabs ajax noeffect htm can you 1 modify the script so that the a selected current menu tab if clicked will reload itself again 2 modify the script so the content pages ajax1 2 3 htm in the demo can have CLICK FOR MORE links on them to load a second page of content into the currently selected tab then the overlay would work i think fine is that easily do able with jquerytools using simple commands cheers wolfie Hiya again I hope changing the question didn t put you off The Overlay simply will not work every time if the content is loaded into tabs by ajax and the overlay link itself is inside a loaded content page I m sorry to destract from that i THOUGHT i d found a fix elsewhere but found I was wrong after hours of testing So is there anyway to make the overlay work when the link is inside a content pages loaded into tabs using the ajax method http jquerytools github com demos tabs ajax noeffect htm sorry mate I did say I am a beginner There must be a very simple fix for this cos I d imagine alot of people would want to use OVERLAY with the ajax load tabs so is there any way to do it I cant see how that jfiddle thing can help when there is no way to test loading external content pages or is there cheers wolfie just to mention i ve tried a variety of OTHER overlay scripts they all work UNTIL you try and open them from within TABS http jquerytools github com demos tabs ajax noeffect htm so the tabs loading with ajax code breaks all overlay code if the open overlay link is inside the loaded content page weird but it s not only a problem with jquerytools OVERLAY it s the same for all overlay scripts i tried cheers wolfie oh well I Guess he went awol lol For anyone interested I fixed it But had to use a different jquery code to load the tabs but it all works I can load the tabs from menu with ajax then i can do page loads into any currently selected tab using ajax links and the overlay effect works for links in the tabs which load sorted and it works also with ie6 If i get time i ll put a demo up somewhere cos this seems to bug alot of people Hi wolfmeister Apologies I m still here I ve just had a very busy few days finishing off a major project I was also starting testing for the next release of jQuery Tools now that jQuery has been updated to 1 8 I would be grateful if you could please try and put up a demo I would be interested to know how you solved it and see if there is anything that could or should be considered for future releases If it helps you can put it up in a JSFiddle www jsfiddle net PS Any reason for needing to design for IE6 It s old technology and should be quietly put to sleep chuckle hiya well i checked the google stats and 6 clients are still using ie6 and anyways it s nice if it does work with ie6 saves faffing around on fixes i solved it by using an alternative javascript to load the tabs found here http yensdesign com 2008 12 how to load content via ajax in jquery then i tweaked it all yes sorry this is the demo page http www yensdesign com tutorials contentajax I changed it so it fades in out rather than sliding use that script with the tabs css from jquerytools org and overlay and it all works Hi wolfmeister Thanks for this I tried your demo page unfortunately it doesn t seem to do anything in Firefox 14 no no that is not my demo page i dont have a demo page setup anywhere What i mean is you take the yendesign javascript to load the content pages into the tabs http www yensdesign com tutorials contentajax and use that yendesign javascript with the tabs layout css from jquerytools org http jquerytools github com demos tabs ajax noeffect htm put them together and then the jquerytools org OVERLAY works if you have Overlay pop ups on the loaded content pages I should put up a demo if i have time But trust me it works in all browsers i ve tried inc ie6 even This is good cos i tried 4 or 5 other pop up lightbox scripts with the jquerytools org tabs and none of them worked they all suffered the same problem as the jquerytools org Overlay so the problem is with the javascript used with the jquerytools org tabs not the Overlay script If there is a downside it is that the yendesign script doesnt seem to have a History Closing due to lack of activity please reopen if this is still an

9734633,924,2013-01-07T14:07:23Z,"Hidden elements don t get scrolled properly visually","To reproduce the bug I have a scrollable list of images The list is hidden by default it shows only after some user interaction Now if I scrolled my scrollable either with next or with seekTo then my list will be in a state when the list wouldn t show the group of images that I want but it would think it does In my example I make a scroll with a next call After showing the list it will still show the first group of images with the index 0 but will store a state as if it stored the second group with index 1 the back button is showed if I click the next button the third group will be showed I have a small example at http dl dropbox com u 442774 bugreport jquery scrollable test html","Hi ytg I ve had a look at the above based on what I ve read of your comments I m not 100 sure if you ve gotten the right calls there At present your dropbox demo has scrollable scrollable next 0 as a call as I understand it you re expecting this to go to index 0 ie show the first group of images right I m not sure this is what Scrollable will do I believe that the next 0 call you have here will actually only scroll 1 item to the right the value in brackets here is actually the speed value not the index number I think the method you may be looking for is possibly move FYI you may want to transfer your demo into a JSFiddle we can then edit it and save new versions which makes it easier Hi alibby251 I expect it to work according to the documentation Yes next 0 should show the next group with the speed of 0 Which should have been called duration but that s not the concern here Yet it doesn t show the next group it shows the first group But it thinks that it shows the next group And thanks for your consideration I prefer dropbox Hi ytg Mmm I m still not 100 convinced that your code is quite right I think the call you need should actually be var api #scrollable data scrollable api next 0 and not the 2 scrollable lines you have there already This should then scroll onto the next item and use 0 as the speed I m assuming that you want it to be instantaneous hence the reason for wanting to use 0 I m also not sure of the reason for needing to hide or show the #test DIV as you have done in your code was there something you were trying to do there Fair point though on the mis naming of the speed attribute though changing it though at this time may confuse people so might have to look at how this could be handled I tried to do the call the way you did it It works the very same way Yes I want it to be instantaneous but that part is really irrelevant I m hiding the #test DIV because that triggers the bug Without hiding it scrolling works just fine Here is the same file without hiding #test http dl dropbox com u 442774 bugreport jquery scrollable test ok html Ah OK I m puzzled by something though is there a reason for needing a non visible scrollable element to be scrolled I m struggling to think of a use case where this would apply The reason for asking is that I am not sure if Scrollable was intended for this purpose so I m keen to learn more of what you are trying to achieve here Background chooser Lots of backgrounds each with a radio button The users can choose which one they intend to use The list would get scrolled to the selected background by default on page load But the UI was a little bit crowded there were hell a lot of other options too so settings were broken down into sections with only the default section visible The rest is shown by jQuery UI s Accordion I don t have access to the actual code right now and I don t remember perfectly but I think due to Accordion s or some other jQuery thing s behaviour doing the scrolling onshow seemed impossible And I didn t really investigate that much because I personally think that triggering a chain of effects for a single click from the user can kinda ruin the user experience so it would be better to do the scrolling while the images are hidden Hi Ah Ok this kinda makes sense now I m assuming though that the reason for using next 0 was to move to the chosen background image right I would have thought that as a starting point seekTo x y where x index of the item and y the speed might have been a better way forward Something else that has come to mind please forgive me if you have already tried this but have you considered simply using CSS to hide the #test DIV that you are using at least on page load It might work better if you used jQuery s css method to hide it rather than show or hide You could set up 2 styles in your stylesheet 1 to hide the DIV and one to show it then simply swap between the two Just a thought apologies if it misses the mark Well thanks for trying to help with my issue but neither seekTo nor CSS manipulation works More importantly my original purpose was to file a bug Hidden elements don t get scrolled properly visually That s it No worries sorry

have access to commit patches that people submit once they ve been tested Unfortunately I don t have any developer support at present so do need to rely on people submitting patches for testing I am hoping to try to do some testing on Tools with a view to working out what needs fixing for the next release I ve been working on other projects over the last few months which are coming to a close as we speak If you would like to help contribute please do let me know I would appreciate the help I would like to push for the next release of Tools to have support for jQuery 1 9 x I am aware that the jQuery team have been pushing the boat out so it will be interesting to see exactly how much they have broken As a starting point I think the jQuery Team made available a migration plugin that you can use which highlights what if any changes you need to make I have not yet had a chance to test this with Tools but it might be worth a try hopefully it might give us more indication of what needs fixing Have a look at http jquery com download the compressed production version is available at http code jquery com jquery migrate 1 0 0 min js I d welcome any feedback Hi alibby251 I m using the dateinput widget and just switched to jQuery v1 9 0 Here is an easy temp fix line 303 of current Github code was if e type click browser msie make it if e type click document all It might not be perfect but only Opera users might not be able to focus on the input like they use to Hi mobilesiteos Thanks for this I appreciate it When you tested it did you get any other issues crop up at all or was it just Opera that had the above issue you mention I ve just run some preliminary tests with the all version of the Tools CDN link using the migrate plugin available from jQuery it seems that adding this in script src http code jquery com jquery migrate 1 0 0 js script does at least seem to make things work when using this CDN link at least for me I know it is not meant as a permanent fix but hopefully should be a good starting point for anyone who wants to test with 1 9 The good news is that Minimal Tabs demo seems to work OK with jQuery 1 9 at least for me It s a very easy fix just made it for some modules such as the overlay @alibby251 the jquery migrate plugin worked for me as well cheers I m using the all version of the Tools CDN link @zimok jquerytools rocks has great documentation http jquerytools org documentation and feels anything but oldish Hi mayinx Thanks for your comments it s good to know the migrate plugin helped To help with development I would love to know what feedback your browser gives when using the migrate plugin with Tools To find out you will need to look at the console I ve found a good way to do this is using Firefox and Firebug any chance you might be able to help on this please @BMCouto I ve seen your comment about your fix any chance you might be able to share please I can look to get it incorporated into the next release provided it tests OK @zimok I m curious as to what makes you think Tools is oldish Tools was very much designed to be minimalistic giving you as the user plenty of scope to do with as you wish Granted it has been around a few years and yes there are parts that could be now replicated using CSS3 However it is unlikely this is going to be something that could be done in a completely mainstream context until developers designers only need to support newer browsers and not legacy ones such as IE6 7 8 I could easily see Tools being used with something like Modernizr to act as a fallback for CSS3 effects It is very much a case of not trying to reinvent the wheel it s more a case of providing a means that compliments existing HTML5 technology a good example being the Form Tools In this instance for example Tero provided functionality such as providing a means to add custom validators that compliments the existing HTML5 capability that is already available in most modern ish browsers I m happy to consider patches etc that add to this existing functionality and to any other part of the library I m working on keeping the library very lean fast and concise with any functionality being useful to the majority of users In terms of the support though Tero has always meant that Tools would be supported on a community led basis I help out as a form admin to try to keep some sense of order However it is very much open to anyone to help out particularly for posting bug reports fixes etc as well as support those new to the library I always welcome support if you think the documentation is poor

now at least @kmcphillips is there a particular part of the library you are keen on using I m trying to cover all parts as time permits I m happy to look at particular parts if you have a need for using them It would be with jQuery 1 9 x as a minimum offical supported version but I suspect older versions may still work No I m good Mostly I was maintaining an app updating some ruby gems to patch some security holes and I guess the jQuery version was included in the updates I m glad that the jquery migrate alleviated me of having to update jQuery Tools and all sorts of other things too then regression test PS this site still says 1 4 jQuery best practices Now you can use bind method to assign event listeners and use the data method to access the programming API Both are well known

not tested tools validator fn minlength function input value var checked false var els name el attr name each function i el if el is checked checked checked true return checked true false There s no need to add the required field on it as this is handled in the code by default I do know that there are some issues still outstanding which need to be resolved have a _good_ look through Github as a starting point I think issue #733 is one that comes to mind Ohhh that s amazing i swear you deserve a nice pint of beer just for your info and if you ll give this solution to someone else you should replace input by el in the first line I do have some more questions PLEASE 1 do I have to add minlength 1 attribute to the checkboxes I m asking this question coz I already have a custom validator function for min length tools validator fn minlength function input value var min_char input attr minlength return value length min_char true false and I m just afraid i ll face a conflict later 2 when I submit without checking 1 box the error message shows just above the checkbox how can I make it disapear once i click on a box 3 I think it s a little bug but maybe not when i submit the first time the error messages shows if I submit a second time the error texts move up for 2 or 3 pixels is that normal Thank you SSSOOO much Reda From alibby251 notifications@github com To jquerytools

this The above validator is actually ironically meant for min length it was meant as an example of i how i you can use a custom validator Admittedly I should have put in a more appropriate selector though the one you will need is going to need to be based on whatever your radio buttons have been called I think it will be something like this radio Have a good look through Github there are a fair few issue logs still around for Validator and radio buttons in particular I know that people have posted some good code fixes samples there I have also posted a number of demos in JSFiddle as part of the testing for the next release of Tools the details are in the Github issue log to which you can get to from the Issues link at the top of this page Have a look for those that begin with TESTING I think this was what I used to start them With regards to the messages showing can you please put an example into a JSFiddle so I can take a look Nine times out of ten it can just be down to CSS or a config option needs changing I can usually tell once I have something in front of me I would also use a copy of the Validator code that is in the JSFiddle tests I mention above I ve tried out a few code fixes there before committing them to source I suspect this may help you on the two issues you ve mentioned Hi Redani Sorry for the delay in coming back to you it s been a crazy few weeks I ve had another look at the original problem where you are using an offset in your code I can t be sure but I i think i it may be the offset that is causing an issue Could you please first try removing

12756854,979,2013-04-03T15:09:03Z,"Multiple Calendar Inputs always open","Hello how to I add 2 Calendar Inputs to a Form both anytime visible","Hi daslicht I think as a basic idea you could try instigating an instance of DateInput s API using something like var api date data dateinput then use api show as part of the rendering the form on the page Alternatively you can use the always open DateInput format which is available here http jquerytools org demos dateinput static html don t be put off by the fact that the calendar looks huge this is just the way the CSS has been set and you can override all of this by providing your own styling based on what is listed in http jquerytools org media css dateinput large css Yeh I saw that but how to have 2 Calendars open at the same time Hi daslicht Were you thinking of using the static demo example to show your dateinputs if so then you should just need to use different name IDs against each one and duplicate the calls to the DateInput library Have a look at the static demo URL I posted in my previous post you can then duplicate the code to something like this #date1 dateinput closing is not possible onHide function return false when date changes update the day display change function e date #theday html this getValue dd span mmmm yyyy span set initial value and show dateinput when page loads data dateinput setValue 0 show #date2 dateinput closing is not possible onHide function return false when date changes update the day display change function e date #theday html this getValue dd span mmmm yyyy span set initial value and show dateinput when page loads data dateinput setValue 0 show Give this a try let me know if it helps This results into something like this http jsfiddle net daslicht 43CyX Best Regards and Thank you Marc I managed to do it by setting the root css property http jsfiddle net daslicht XtDXW Is there a way to have a valid date as value yyyy mm dd but display something more fancy like 19 05 2013 Looks like that it is not working that way either The created date input contains ID which gets created double eg #calhead But more serious is the following If you set the date on one input the other loses its blue default color highlight Is there a way that I can have 2 calendars both showing the actual selected date as blue highlight http jsfiddle net daslicht XtDXW 1 Best Regards Marc Hi Marc Thanks for the update in terms of setting a date format I think you need to look at using the data value attribute as per the docs here http jquerytools org documentation dateinput index html You can use this to set the initial value shown is this what you are after I think the blue color is only because the first calendar has lost focus if you use the API instance of DateInput I think you can then use normal jQuery methods such as blur to control what happens when the form loses focus Cheers Alex I have notices that when I click one date the calfocus class is not removed and set to the clicked date Try it please http jsfiddle net daslicht XtDXW 1 Regarding the date input If I set the format to anything else than yyyy mm dd I get errors when validating forms in symfony2 since it needs exactly that format Looks like I would need 2 different values one being displayed and another which is send to the server But this isn t that serious since I am planing to hide those inputs anyways and just display both calendars side by side at any time Have a nice weekend Marc Hi Marc I think the issue i may i be because you re using the same root attribute in both instances I would try something like #date1 dateinput css prefix date1 root dateinput1 head datehead1 #date2 dateinput css prefix date2 root dateinput2 head datehead2 I ve used simple examples here but the idea is to specify two sets of css styles one for the first dateinput and the 2nd for the other dateinput DateInput uses the same set of basic styles in each instance but you can specify prefixes that effectively turn each into separate styles So here the first DateInput will have a style of date1head date1title and so on whereas the second one will have date2head date2title etc I would read the Skinning section at this URL very carefully http jquerytools org documentation dateinput index html#skinning it explains everything you should need I know that from experience most if not all components from the JQT library should work together if multiple instances are on the same page it s just a matter of making sure that each has its own selector IDs and or CSS styles specified Hi Marc Setting the data value shouldn t cause an issue for Symphony2 this is only what is displayed in the inputbox for DateInput the format set in the format attribute will dictate the response that Symphony2 should receive I would point out though that from a usability perspective it will look odd if users see the first date format of XX XX XX but it change to what is set via the format attribute in DateInput is there a reason for needing both formats Hello setting the root did not change a thing When i add prefix and head the calendar isn t shown at all http jsfiddle net daslicht XtDXW 3 I trued the setValue function but when I try to use it I get the error to much recursion http jsfiddle net daslicht XtDXW 5 the date variable in the change handler is undefined Cheers Marc We have decided to go with the Flight example now Is there a way that the Calendar fade in and not just appear or get bigger like using the show option Hi daslicht I thought that might be a sensible choice given that trying to display both calendars in full isn t necessarily a good way to do it from a usability perspective In terms of setting the root CSS I don t think it s enough to simply change the root in the JS call to DateInput the CSS styles in your stylesheet also need to change as well For example if you have calroot as the default style and you specify date1 as your root then you need to have date1root in your CSS as well With regards to http jsfiddle net daslicht XtDXW 5 are you trying to change the format of the date that shows so it works for Symphony @alibby251 I dont do the decisions I just do the work my client wants me to do Do you know how to fade in the Calendars of the Flight Example Hehe yes clients do pay the bills chuckle You can try something like this

jQuery Tools tilte parameter cross site scripting jquerytools tooltip title xss 78122 Medium Risk Description Tootip component for jQuery Tools is vulnerable to cross site scripting caused by improper validation of user supplied input A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using the title parameter in a specially crafted URL to execute script in a victim s Web browser within the security context of the hosting Web site once the URL is clicked An attacker could use this vulnerability to steal the victim s cookie based authentication credentials Consequences Gain Access Remedy No remedy available as of September 1 2013 References Packet Storm Web site JQuery Tooltip Cross Site Scripting Tooltip component for jQuery Tools Web Site jQuery TOOLS The missing UI library for the Web Platforms Affected jQuery Tools Tootip component for jQuery Tool Reported Aug 28 2012 Hi donnerlin I ve been doing some investigating I think this relates to the ability to use custom HTML code within the Tooltip In a nutshell cross site scripting relates to how a user with malicious intent could try to intercept the HTML code that forms the content within the Tooltip and replace it or inject with their own code this code could do any level of damage depending on what is injected It does open up a can of worms as to how best to protect against it the Tools library was originally intended to be a pet project of Tero of Flowplayer fame www flowplayer org It therefore wasn t necessarily going to include the level of functionality or security of other libraries but would give any developer enough flexibility to run with the code and do as they wish FYI I came along to help out in the original forums and now here in Github as time permits In terms of how to go forward there are several options available here the key to all of this is to keep in mind your intended audience and whether they are internal or network users this will become clear in a moment 1 Make sure your pages have the correct charset in the code it will be something like meta charset UTF 8 This will help IE correctly identify the character set that will be used in your pages If you need an example of how this should look please shout 2 I would recommend at least b not b including HTML code in the Tooltip I know this is possible with Tool s Tooltip functionality but the library was written at a time when cross site scripting was less of an issue than it is now I know of at least one other library that doesn t allow HTML code within it s Tooltip 3 If you need to then ensure your code is escaped this is probably outside of the scope of what can be included here but there are HUNDREDS of articles on the Internet for this Put simply it means changing any HTML tags such as html to their escaped equivalents which here would be lthtml gt Please note this should be done for ALL HTML tags used within the tooltip it s meant to reduce any instance where an attacker could intercept the HTML code and replace it with their own As a start have a look through this StackOverflow article carefully there are some good tips there http stackoverflow com questions 24816 escaping html strings with jquery 4 I have also found that some kind soul has actually written a patch for this issue which is available at #853 I ve not had any chance to fully investigate or test it yet but will do so as soon as I get a spare moment I hope the above helps please do let me know how you get on That s great information thanks I personally don t see the issue as a big deal For me it s the red tape I have to go through to get permission to use outside tools which is the main reason I posted it If you ve ever worked for a big company you may know what I m talking about There s probably others fighting the same battles lone developers working for big companies trying to find tools to help them do their jobs I will add to the comments on that thread you pointed to and see if I can encourage them to incorporate the patch
