Currently. this will not change existing charts.\n\n```\ntooltips: {\n  positionMode: 'average'\n}\n```\n\nAlso implemented is the 'nearest' mode which places the tooltip on the element closest to the event that triggered the tooltip. Implementing this required removing some of the optimizations from `ChartController#eventHandler`. This may not be acceptable so there may need to be some refactoring.\n\nThis addresses #2056\n\nCC @chartjs/maintainers \n","closed",false,"2016-10-10T01:30:15.000Z","2016-10-15T20:48:16.000Z","2016-10-14T21:36:49.000Z",true,,4,4,8,6,166,84,4,"COMMENTED","","etimberg"

For better explanation check #4041 \r\n- **Ignoring the offsetGridLines option:** when offsetGridLines option is enabled there is one less tick label than there should be tick marks and gridLines. Iterating through ticks array without respecting the option was resulting in one missing gridLine and tick mark\r\n\r\n## Added functionality:\r\n- **Borders:** there is an option to enable border on any axis resulting in the ability to set following border options: color, lineWidth, borderDash, borderDashOffset \r\n\r\n## \r\nI havent updated the documentation yet, but I want to start the pull request already as there is quite a lot to review and update the documentation while it is being reviewed.\r\nAlso please ignore the first two commits by Cizmarik as his pull request was already merged yesterday with those changes.
