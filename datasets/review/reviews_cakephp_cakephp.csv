Returns true If driver is supporting EXPLAIN statement for the specified query. Mysql, Postgres and Sqlite will return true if the specified query starts with SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE. Sqlserver or other unknown drivers will always return false.\n- Added `Connection::explain()` method. Excecutes EXPLAIN query If driver is supporting EXPLAIN statement. If not supporting, throws an exception.\n- Added `LoggedQuery::$queryString` property because `LoggedQuery::$query` may be modified by QueryLogger. If LoggedQuery doesn't keep original query, DebugKit cannot execute correct EXPLAIN query.\n### Usage\n\n``` php\n$connection = ConnectionManager::get('default');\n$query = 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = :id';\nif ($connection->canExplan($query)) {\n    $stmt = $connection->explain($query, ['id' => 1], ['id' => 'integer']);\n    $result = $stmt->fetchAll();\n}\n```\n\n**Edit:** Fixed incorrect explanation \n","closed",false,"2016-09-06T13:01:22.000Z","2016-11-16T11:56:04.000Z","2016-10-05T04:13:54.000Z",false,false,7,7,30,3,324,4,15,"COMMENTED","","markstory"

Returns true If driver is supporting EXPLAIN statement for the specified query. Mysql, Postgres and Sqlite will return true if the specified query starts with SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE. Sqlserver or other unknown drivers will always return false.\n- Added `Connection::explain()` method. Excecutes EXPLAIN query If driver is supporting EXPLAIN statement. If not supporting, throws an exception.\n- Added `LoggedQuery::$queryString` property because `LoggedQuery::$query` may be modified by QueryLogger. If LoggedQuery doesn't keep original query, DebugKit cannot execute correct EXPLAIN query.\n### Usage\n\n``` php\n$connection = ConnectionManager::get('default');\n$query = 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = :id';\nif ($connection->canExplan($query)) {\n    $stmt = $connection->explain($query, ['id' => 1], ['id' => 'integer']);\n    $result = $stmt->fetchAll();\n}\n```\n\n**Edit:** Fixed incorrect explanation \n","closed",false,"2016-09-06T13:01:22.000Z","2016-11-16T11:56:04.000Z","2016-10-05T04:13:54.000Z",false,false,7,7,30,3,324,4,15,"COMMENTED","","chinpei215"

Can be done later.\r\n\r\nWorth mentioning:\r\n\r\n- `Query::bufferResults($enablel)` is now `enableBufferedResults()`/`isEnabledBufferedResults()`.\r\n- `Connection::useSavePoints($enable)` is now `enableSavePoints()`/`isEnabledSavePoints()`.\r\n\r\nBetter ideas for names welcome. This way it would be consistent, though - and `is...` shows that this is of bool result.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nRemark for the future:\r\n- We must more declare properties in the tests, just `$this->foo = new Foo()` provides no typehinting etc. This makes the tests and refactoring very difficult.

This is PR to integrate [PHPStan](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan) into the CI build of CakePHP.\r\n\r\nIt's a work in progress since there are quite a lot of errors in the build log. `@property` annotations are already supported by PHPStan, but it still found some undefined properties.\r\n\r\nEven after merging this PR, I expect to continue to work with you on increasing the level of strictness of the analysis and also on updating to newer versions of PHPStan :)\r\n\r\nI'd like one of the maintainers to go through the error log and fix obvious errors in the code. We can then work together on the other, more questionable, errors.","closed",false,"2016-12-29T14:13:52.000Z","2016-12-30T17:02:10.000Z","2016-12-30T17:02:07.000Z",false,false,15,20,20,5,29,93,20,"COMMENTED","","ondrejmirtes"

Changing association name without manually reattaching it in a collection makes it unusable. `EagerLoader` [checks if these names match](https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/blob/3.next/src/ORM/EagerLoader.php#L496) and throws an exception. Is this exception enough or should we disallow changing association name as it would probably break it?\r\n\r\nIn other words `AssociationCollection` key, `Association` name and target `Table` alias should be identical. Changing one of them would probably break things.\r\n\r\nMy way to improve this is to check if a new association name matches the target table alias **after** it has been resolved.\r\n\r\nThere's also an issue with `AssociationCollection` not reflecting association name change, but I'm not sure we can do anything about it without changing the way associations are collected.","closed",false,"2017-02-03T09:53:03.000Z","2017-02-08T08:58:03.000Z","2017-02-07T17:58:28.000Z",true,,4,1,0,2,43,0,2,"CHANGES_REQUESTED","Looks ok to me, but needs some tests.","markstory"

By reworking how we generate aliases and eagerloader aliases we can enable the `targetTable` option to behave as intended. The foreignKey will need to be set, when used with `targetTable` and a table that doesn't have a matching alias, but I think that is reasonable given how key generation uses the table's alias for other reasons.\r\n\r\nI've had to replace target aliases with the association names, so that the selected fields reflect the association's alias and not the table's original alias. I don't think this will cause problems with application code that relies on the target table's alias being used, as aliases always had to match between the association and table instance. One situation that could be problematic with the new code is if a user is using `$table->aliasField()` in query expressions for association finders. Because the table's alias and association alias no longer have be the same, mismatching aliases could end up in the same query.\r\n\r\nRefs #7125\r\nRefs #10410","closed",false,"2017-03-15T02:32:23.000Z","2017-03-15T19:31:35.000Z","2017-03-15T07:13:57.000Z",true,,4,1,1,1,46,25,5,"COMMENTED","","markstory"

Most of the issues were missing annotations, however there were some minor code changes. I broke up my changes into separate commits for better clarity as well as to allow cherry-picking.\r\n\r\nFYI: I avoided the best I could adding missing annotations for deprecated code, wasn't sure it was absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\n~~P.S. I am still pushing commits, I am using this PR to help with automatic lint, etc. I will update this PR when I am done.~~\r\n\r\n~~EDIT: I am done with this PR now, I did it this way to avoid a ton of PR's. This way, you can pick and choose what changes you want to bring into the core. All changes have been ran through static code analysis and there should not be any problems, but you guys are the experts so I will leave it to you at this point. Thanks!~~\r\n\r\nUPDATE: I have split this PR into multiple PR's per request of core team. Please see below, referenced PR's.","closed",false,"2017-04-17T08:14:11.000Z","2017-04-17T12:01:22.000Z","2017-04-17T11:28:05.000Z",false,false,5,4,4,69,1931,573,299,"COMMENTED","","Theaxiom"

An example might be falling back to the FileEngine if Redis fails to connect:\r\n\r\n```php\r\nCache::setConfig('tests', [\r\n    'engine' => 'Redis',\r\n    'host' => 'badhost',\r\n    'fallback' => 'tests_fallback'\r\n]);\r\nCache::setConfig('tests_fallback', [\r\n    'engine' => 'File',\r\n    'path' => TMP,\r\n    'prefix' => 'test_',\r\n]);\r\n```\r\n\r\nA developer could configure fallbacks all the way to the NullEngine in order to prevent their app from ever throwing an exception due to missing cache.\r\n\r\nI'd like to discuss potential pitfalls (especially regarding groups, as I do not have much experience with them) of this change. Also, hiding errors isn't a good thing, so ideas on logging those errors are welcome.","closed",false,"2017-06-06T17:29:15.000Z","2017-06-22T01:17:00.000Z","2017-06-22T01:15:04.000Z",true,,7,26,28,8,198,25,3,"COMMENTED","","markstory"
