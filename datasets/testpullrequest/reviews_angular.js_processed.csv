So allowing a malicious attacker to make a JSONP request to an evil server could have bad results.\n\nBy requiring that JSONP urls are trusted we make it easier for developers to see that their app is only able to make JSONP requests to urls that they have audited.\n\nThere are two ways to trust:\n- whitelisting the url\n- explicitly marking a url as trusted by calling `$sce.trustAs`\n\nThe first commit in this PR ensures that all JSONP requests use a URL that is validated against the `$sce` ResourceUrl whitelist/blacklist checking. This commit creates a Breaking Change for app developers as they must now add all of their JSONP endpoints to the whitelist before their app will work. Although as significant breaking change, it is fairly simple to fix: just search for all calls to `$http.jsonp` and identify the url. Of course if the url is being generated dynamically then this is harder to fix but also indicates that perhaps there is a security vulnerability.\n\nThe second commit allows developers to provide explicitly trusted urls as a result of calling `$sce.trustAsResourceUrl`. This second approach has a few quirks:\n- the `$http` service needs to append parameters to the url, which means that the trusted url must be unwrapped, modified and then re-wrapped as trusted before passing it to `$httpBackend`.\n- it may be possible (??) that there might be an attack vector if an attacker is able to access a different endpoint by changing the parameters. But perhaps since the domain and path cannot be modified by the param serializer this is not an issue?\n\n_Is it acceptable (from a security point of view) to allow parameters to be added to a trusted url? If so then we could refactor the checks to happen in the `$http` service instead of `$httpBackend` which would remove the need for the re-wrapping of the built url._\n\nCloses #11352\nCloses #11328\n",closed,false,2016-09-15T20:31:41.000Z,2016-09-20T09:06:17.000Z,2016-09-20T09:05:54.000Z,false,false,8,14,23,2,66,25,6,7,"  Thanks @gkalpak \n     ",0,,0,,0,,1," ",0,,0,,0,,2,"  ",0,,2,"  ",0,,2,"  ",0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,

This PR adjusts matchUrl() to also consider the base URL (`document.baseURI`) in addition to `location.href` when matching URLs against the 'self' URl policy.\n\nThis PR does not introduce any breaking changes.\n\nSecurity note: SCE policy can be circumvented by rogue `<base>` tags on the page. However, I believe this is not too much of a concern. If an attacker can inject `<base>` tags, then it's very likely they can inject arbitrary HTML, which is a way worse vulnerability.\n",closed,false,2016-09-15T22:38:18.000Z,2017-01-17T11:24:08.000Z,2017-01-10T12:50:45.000Z,false,false,19,11,23,13,156,13,9,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,1," LGTM",3," Looks good in general.

In practice, this turned out to be confusing\nor undesirable for users, since neither native promises nor any other popular promise library\ndistinguishes thrown errors from regular rejections.\n(Note: While this behavior does not go against the Promises/A+ spec, it is not prescribed either.)\n\nThis commit removes the distinction, by skipping the call to `$exceptionHandler()`, thus treating\nthrown errors as regular rejections.\n\n**Note:**\nUnless explicitly turned off, possibly unhandled rejections will still be caught and passed to the\n`$exceptionHandler()`, so errors thrown due to programming errors and not otherwise handled (with a\nsubsequent `onRejected` handler) will not go unnoticed.\n\nBREAKING CHANGE:\n\nPreviously, throwing an error from a promise's `onFulfilled` or `onRejection` handlers, would result\nin passing the error to the `$exceptionHandler()` (in addition to rejecting the promise with the\nerror as reason).\n\nNow, a thrown error is treated exactly the same as a regular rejection. This applies to all\nservices/controllers/filters etc that rely on `$q` (including built-in services, such as `$http` and\n`$route`). For example, `$http`'s `transformRequest/Response` functions or a route's `redirectTo`\nfunction as well as functions specified in a route's `resolve` object, will no longer result in a\ncall to `$exceptionHandler()` if they throw an error. Other than that, everything will continue to\nbehave in the same way; i.e. the promises will be rejected, route transition will be cancelled,\n`$routeChangeError` events will be broadcasted etc.\n\nFixes #3174\nFixes #14745\n",closed,false,2016-10-04T08:17:36.000Z,2016-10-05T11:53:21.000Z,2016-10-05T11:49:56.000Z,false,false,1,10,12,3,180,203,9,2,"  ",1," ",1," A few minor things but generally LGTM\n",0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,4,"    ",0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,2,"  ",0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,

Results are:\n- create:\n  - it improves the performance around 5%~10% (faster compile time)\n- other cases:\n  - no appreciable changes\n\nSo, as a conclusion, it seems that the **#15228  optimizes automatically code in the same fashion that an experienced angular programmers would do** manually. \nIn the other hand, given that 1 frame is around 16ms, we should give 8ms to the browser to update, it leaves 8ms for the application to work. Experiments show that digest loop times moves from values like 8 or 10ms to just 1ms in large lists, or 0.01ms in a single big object condition.\n",closed,false,2016-10-10T16:59:33.000Z,2016-12-09T10:21:29.000Z,2016-12-09T10:21:29.000Z,false,,1,4,7,1,300,0,3,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,1," Nice!

If the element is destroyed (ex: it was inside ngIf or ngRepeat) it assigns a null.\n\n``` html\n<toggle ng-as=""burger""></toggle>\n<menu ng-if=""burger.isVisible""></menu>\n...\n<countdown-timer ng-as=""$ctrl.countdownTimer""></countdown-timer>\n<button ng-click=""$ctrl.relaunch()""></button>\n```\n\n**Does this PR introduce a breaking change?** \nNo.\n\n**Please check if the PR fulfills these requirements**\n- [X] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-message-format\n- [X] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\n- [X] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\n\n**Other information**:\n\nI present in this PR the implementation of a directive that I use in almost all my projects (and other projects in which I'm consultant) since the last year.\n### Basic use\n\nIt is really simple: it publishes the controller of component in the current scope. Ex:\n\n``` html\n<toggle ng-as=""myToggle""></toggle>\n<button ng-click=""myToggle.toggle();"">Toggle</button>\n<p ng-show=""myToggle.isOpened()"">The toggle is active</p>\n```\n\nso it can be accessed from enclosing components. \nUntil this point, it is a kind of custom `controllerAs` property for parent scope.\n### Using with parent components\n\nIn addition, as following the recommendation did by @petebacondarwin in https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/10007#issuecomment-168425866 it is able to assign it to any value, event enclosing controller. Ex:\n\n``` html\n<toggle ng-as=""$ctrl.myToggle""></toggle>\n```\n### ~~Keep track of DOM elements~~\n\nIt also serves to look for exact DOM elements instead of relaying in _jqLite_ searches. In case that there is no a controller, the as directive assigns the current DOM element to the expression set.\n\n``` html\n    <br>From <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio"">here</a>.<br>\n    <player></player>\n    <script>\n        angular.module('demo').component('player', {\n            template: '' +\n                '<audio as=""$ctrl.audio"" src=""http://developer.mozilla.org/@api/deki/files/2926/=AudioTest_(1).ogg""></audio>' +\n                '<button ng-click=""$ctrl.play()"">Play</button>' +\n                '',\n            controller: function() {\n                this.play = function() {\n                    this.audio.play();\n                };\n            },\n        });\n    </script>\n```\n### _Deprecating_ ngController\n#### Why?\n\nngController is great for SEO webpages, but it has the inconvenience that it does not integrates well with bindings and many things have to be done ""manually"". For example:\n\n``` html\n    <script>\n        angular\n            .module('demo', [])\n            .service('booksService', function() {\n                this.getBook = function(id) {\n                    return { name: 'name'+id, abstract: 'abstract...'+id };\n                };\n            });\n    </script>\n\n    <div ng-controller=""BookDetailController as bookDetailCtrl"" book-id=""1"">\n        <h1>{{bookDetailCtrl.book.name}}</h1>\n        <p>{{bookDetailCtrl.book.abstract}}</p>\n    </div>\n    <script>\n        angular.module('demo').controller('BookDetailController', function(booksService,$attrs) {\n            this.book = booksService.getBook($attrs.bookId);\n        });\n    </script>\n```\n\nIn this example it needs to access to `$attrs` manually to find the bookId. You can imagine more complex functionalities, but I think that this is just enough to expose.\n\nNow, imagine that we do a directive to handle the same behaviour:\n\n``` html\n    <static-book-detail book-id=""2"">\n        <h1>{{bookDetailCtrl.book.name}}</h1>\n        <p>{{bookDetailCtrl.book.abstract}}</p>\n    </static-book-detail>\n    <script>\n        angular.module('demo').directive('staticBookDetail', function() {\n            return {\n                scope: true,\n                controller: function(booksService) {\n                    this.book = booksService.getBook(this.bookId);\n                },\n                controllerAs: 'bookDetailCtrl',\n                bindToController: {\n                    bookId: '@',\n                },\n            };\n            this.book = booksService.getBook($attrs.bookId);\n        });\n    </script>\n```\n\nIt has a conceptual problem: you must know by heart that static-book-detail publishes the `bookDetailCtrl`. \n\nAlternatively you can use a component, which always use `$ctrl` like:\n\n``` html\n    <p>Does not works as expected:</p>\n    <static-book-component book-id=""3"">\n        <h1>{{$ctrl.book.name}}</h1>\n        <p>{{$ctrl.book.abstract}}</p>\n    </static-book-component>\n    <script>\n        angular.module('demo').component('staticBookComponent', {\n            bindings: {\n                bookId: '@',\n            },\n            controller: function(booksService) {\n                this.book = booksService.getBook(this.bookId);\n            },\n        });\n    </script>\n```\n\nbut this naive solution does not works because `$ctrl` is not defined in the same scope that code relies.\n#### Popossal\n\nFinally, using as you can have this solution that seems cleaner and more easy to understand:\n\n``` html\n    <p>It dows works (and no implicit):</p>\n    <static-book-component ng-as=""$ctrl"" book-id=""4"">\n        <h1>{{$ctrl.book.name}}</h1>\n        <p>{{$ctrl.book.abstract}}</p>\n    </static-book-component>\n\n    <script>\n        angular.module('demo').component('staticBookComponent', {\n            bindings: {\n                bookId: '@',\n            },\n            controller: function(booksService) {\n                this.book = booksService.getBook(this.bookId);\n            },\n        });\n    </script>\n```\n\n_Additional Notes_: `ngAs` directive behaviour is very close to **Angular2** `#` template variables. It also copies concepts from _RiotJS_ and _Polymer_ (at least first versions).\n",open,false,2016-02-18T17:57:16.000Z,2017-06-29T14:46:42.000Z,,false,,57,33,60,5,542,0,4,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,5,"     ",0,,0,,0,,11,"           ",0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,17,"                 ",0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,

(Bug fix, feature, docs update, ...)**\r\n\r\nPerformance\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior? (You can also link to an open issue here)**\r\n\r\nIn some cases IE11/Edge calls to element.value are very slow when the element.value has not been set. Normally, these calls are usualy 0-3 ms but in these cases it can take 200-300 ms. This can easily add 3 or more seconds to the load time on a view that has 10 or more select tags using ngOptions.\r\n\r\nThe line this pull request is changing not only suffers from the performance issue described above but it also appears to be broken. The code is checking that option.value does not equal element.value but then sets element.value to option.selectValue.

(Bug fix, feature, docs update, ...)**\r\nBug fix.\r\n\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior? (You can also link to an open issue here)**\r\nIn order for `ngModel` and `ngModelOptions` to work correctly together, the latter's pre-linking function should be run before the former's pre-linking function. This is typically what happens, except when `ngModel` is used on an element which also has a `replace` directive, whose template includes `ngModelOptions`. In that case, the order is reversed.\r\nSee #15492 for more details.\r\n\r\n\r\n**What is the new behavior (if this is a feature change)?**\r\nThe initialization logic of `ngModelOptions` is moved from its pre-linking function to its controller's `$onInit()` lifecycle hook. This way, it is always guaranteed to be run before `ngModel`'s pre-linking function, even in the `replace` scenario mentioned above. \r\n\r\n\r\n**Does this PR introduce a breaking change?**\r\nMaybe.\r\nThere is no breaking change wrt 1.5.x (where the initialization of `ngModelOptions` used to take place in the controller itself), but wrt to 1.6.0 the following usecase will no longer be possible:\r\nA sibling directive to `ngModelOptions`, let's call it `foo` could be modifying the model options definition (e.g. `ng-model-options=""modelOptionsDefinition""`) in its `$onInit()` lifecycle hook. If the `foo` directive had a lower priority that `ngModelOptions`, then it will no longer work after this PR, since its `$onInit()` method will be called _after_ `ngModelOptions` is initialized. \r\n(This can be worked around by changing the priority of `foo` to be higher than `ngModelOptions` or by overwriting `ngModelOptions#$options` from `foo#$onInit()`.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Please check if the PR fulfills these requirements**\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-message-format\r\n- [x] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] ~~Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)~~\r\n\r\n**Other information**:\r\nFixes #15492.",closed,false,2016-12-11T20:30:20.000Z,2016-12-12T22:15:19.000Z,2016-12-12T22:10:51.000Z,false,false,1,3,3,3,705,669,3,0,,2," One minor naming suggestion but LGTM.\r\nGood fix @gkalpak  ",0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,1," ",0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,

(Bug fix, feature, docs update, ...)**\r\nBug fix(es).\r\n\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior? (You can also link to an open issue here)**\r\n1. `$browser.$$checkUrlChange()` (which was run before each `$digest`) will only detect an external change (i.e. not via `$location`) to the browser URL. External changes to `history.state` will not be detected and propagated to `$location`.\r\n\r\n   This would not be a problem if changes were followed by a `popstate` or `hashchange` event (which would call `cacheStateAndFireUrlChange()`). But since `history.pushState()/replaceState()` do not fire any events, calling these methods manually will result in `$location` getting out-of-sync with the actual\r\nhistory state.\r\n\r\n   This is not detected in tests, because the mocked `window.history` will incorrectly trigger `popstate` when calling `pushState()/replaceState()`, which ""covers"" the bug.\r\n\r\n2. When the URL is changed directly (e.g. via `location.href`) during a `$digest` (e.g. via `scope.$evalAsync()` or `promise.then()`) the change is not handled correctly, unless a `popstate` or `hashchange` event is fired synchronously.\r\n\r\n   This is an issue when calling `history.pushState()/replaceState()` in all browsers, since these methods do not emit any event. This is also an issue when setting `location.href` in IE11, where (unlike other browsers) no `popstate` event is fired at all for hash-only changes ([known bug][1]) and the `hashchange` event is fired asynchronously (which is too late).\r\n\r\n\r\n**What is the new behavior (if this is a feature change)?**\r\n1. The first bug is fixed by ensuring `cacheState()` is always called, before looking for and propagating a URL/state change.\r\n\r\n2. The second bug(s) is fixed by:\r\n   1. Keeping track of `$location` setter methods being called and only processing a URL change if it originated from such a call.

(Bug fix, feature, docs update, ...)**\n\nThis is an improvement to  uniformize the secure context code, by making the $sce handle URL-context in roughly the same way it handles HTML-context. That also required a more silent change, to have $sce-contexts where concatenation of values is allowed (described below).\n\n**What is the current behavior? (You can also link to an open issue here)**\n\nCurrently, the whole $sce.URL context is unused. Dynamically-set URLs that are sanitized through various codepaths (mostly in compile.js, $set function). \n\nUsually, if one wants to force a value through Angular's security mechanisms, the $sce.trustAs function should be used. There's no straightforward way to do it in a single place for URLs, as `<a href=""{{sce.trustAsUrl(foo)}}"">` sanitizes silently its link. \n\nAlso, an attribute being a $sce context means that concatenations are blocked: `<iframe src=""generate.php?{{params}}"">` would throw for instance. However, since it's not a $sce context, `<img src=""generate.php?{{params}}""/>` is fine.\n\n**What is the new behavior (if this is a feature change)?**\n\nThe new behavior makes Angular handle URLs with the $sce service, similarly to HTML context. $sce.trustAsUrl is now useful, as it allows bypassing the sanitization. If one uses plain strings in URL-context attributes, they will be sanitized through the existing $$sanitizeUri service.\n\nI also have tweaked $interpolate to work as expected with concatenated values in select secure contexts. In the listed contexts (URL only for now, though that could be expanded to anything), trustAs'd values with no concatenations are not sanitized (eg `""{{trustedVar}}""` works as you'd expect), and anything else is downgraded to string, concatenated if needed, and then passed to $sce.getTrusted that handles the sanitization as usual. For instance, `""java{{trustAsUrl('script:evil();')}}""` is sanitized as it should.\n\n**Does this PR introduce a breaking change?**\n\nYes: I've merged both URL sanitization methods in $$sanitizeUri (since there's a single $sce.URL context). This will break the applications that edit one of these whitelists, but I believe there's security benefits in doing so, as they will be able to use trustAsUrl in specific parts of their application instead of having to blanket-approve the special scheme they rely on. Otherwise, I believe the changes are backwards-compatible unless you're really hooking into Angular internals.\n\n**Please check if the PR fulfills these requirements**\n- [X] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-message-format\n- [X] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\n- [X] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\n\n**Other information**:\n\nI'm from Google security, but I'm not right all the time, so please ask about anything: I might have missed something, or this might not be something you want. I had to modifiy components I'm not that familiar with. Things to check:\n- If you had special reasons to split the URL sanitization in two parts, I haven't been able to find it. I just merged the whitelists. \n- I'm not entirely sure of the $interpolate change. I've had several issues with infinite digests with arrays while developping, the latest changes seem to pass, but there might still be dragons hidden in there.\n- I'm not sure either I got all the doc modified. \n- Finally, $sce.HTML / $sce.RESOURCE_URL could also be concatenated. At least for HTML it works, and you could have something like the commented-out test in sceSpecs.js, but I'm not sure it brings much value here, so I've left it disabled for now. RESOURCE_URL could follow the same path with either completely-trusted URLs, or concatenated-then-treated-as-string URLs that would be checked against the whitelist/blacklist mechanism. \n",open,false,2016-03-16T14:04:10.000Z,2017-06-29T14:45:09.000Z,,false,false,13,8,22,6,419,243,12,1," ",1," I have downloaded and rebased this locally - not a trivial task since this PR is getting quite old.\r\nIt looks good to me but since this is all hitting security sensitive code, I would like two more LGTM from core AngularJS members.",0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,1," ",0,,0,,0,,5,"     ",0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,

If you still need a touch override, consider using\r\n[Fastclick](https://github.com/ftlabs/fastclick).\r\n\r\nNote that the `$touch` service still offers the `ngClickOverrideEnabled()` function for\r\nlibraries that want to detect if an app uses the click override. Starting with 1.7.0, it\r\nwill always return `false`.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther info:\r\n\r\nThis one is a bit tricky, as we have deprecated the ngClick directive, but at the same time introduced two new APIs: $touchProvider.ngClickOverrideEnabled and $touch.ngClickOverrideEnabled().\r\nI have removed the former, because it's directly tied to the directive. I think that's fine, as someone who uses the ngClick override must migrate to a different solution anyway, and will see an error when he updates and the provider fn is missing. I've kept the actual provider for the unlikely case that we introduce new config for the ngTouch module.\r\nI've also kept the $touch.ngClickOverrideEnabled() method, as this one is used by material to check if they should include their own touch stuff. I think if we removed this then they wouldn't be able to determine if the ngClick override is present (because ngTouch module but no $touch service could also mean a pre 1.5.0 version of ngTouch)\r\n",closed,false,2017-02-28T17:27:19.000Z,2017-03-14T10:48:55.000Z,2017-03-14T10:48:55.000Z,true,,19,8,6,4,3,1154,5,0,,0,,0,,0,,1," ",0,,0,,0,,2,"  ",0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,1," ",2,"  ",2,"  @Narretz Re commit msg:\r\n\r\n> and with the also the\r\n\r\nA typo.\r\n\r\n> - Since iOS 8, Safari removes the delay on so-called ""slow taps"".\r\n\r\nThis is incomplete.

Caja is written in Java, though, where problems with `toLowerCase`\r\nworking differently in Turkish locale are well known[1]. In JavaScript\r\n`String#toLowerCase` is defined in the ECMAScript spec and all implementations\r\nare required to lowercase I in the same way, regardless of the current locale.\r\nDifferences may (and do) happen only in `String#toLocaleLowerCase`.\r\n\r\nOther libraries doing string normalization, like jQuery or DOMPurify don't\r\napply special lowercasing logic in a Turkish environment.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the `manualLowercase` & `manualUppercase` logic is dead code in\r\nAngularJS and can be removed.\r\n\r\nAlso, the `manualLowercase` & `manualUppercase` functions are incomplete; they\r\nonly lowercase ASCII characters which is different to native\r\n`String#toLowerCase`. Since those functions are used in many places in the\r\nlibrary, they would break a lot of code. For example, the lowercase filter would\r\nnot lowercase Ω to ω but leave it as Ω.\r\n\r\n[1] https://garygregory.wordpress.com/2015/11/03/java-lowercase-conversion-turkey/\r\n\r\nRef #11387\r\n\r\n**What kind of change does this PR introduce?

But if that expression then gets wrapped in an interceptor such as `$parse('[var]', interceptor)` we must assume the `interceptor` is non-pure and might read state from within the `var` (just like filters/functions...).\r\n\r\nThis tries to preserve shallow watching of things behind operators such as `!` by distinguishing if an expression is pure due to an operator such as `!` (""absolute"") or pure only if no parent operation wants to deep watch it (""relative"").  This way when wrapped in an interceptor the ""absolute"" ones can still be shallow watched, while the ""relative"" ones that the interceptor has access to can no longer be shallow watched.\r\n\r\nThis still doesn't fully restore the 1.6.3 ng-class functionality because it still doesn't do a deep-watch for one-time bindings like 1.6.3 did. The one (famous last words...) remaining regression from 1.6.3 is demonstrated by the modified ng-class spec (objects-in-literals-with-interceptors-in-one-time bindings).  This is due to [this annoying condition](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/b5118ac6a9e0a327b31094b3fdcdc0432b23ad2f/src/ng/parse.js#L1946-L1948) which I really wish I could find a better method of doing...",closed,false,2017-05-27T07:40:42.000Z,2017-06-13T04:30:38.000Z,2017-06-13T04:30:38.000Z,true,,3,8,8,1,51,7,3,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,6,"      ",0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,2," I know that this PR *works* as it solves the specific issue, but I think it does so at a very high cost.

If the cancelling was outside a digest this could cause a new digest such as with the ng-model `debounce` option.\r\n\r\nFixes #16057,closed,false,2017-06-21T05:35:48.000Z,2017-07-03T09:04:18.000Z,2017-07-03T09:04:18.000Z,true,,3,8,9,1,48,8,8,0,,0,,0,,0,,3,"   ",0,,1," ",0,,1," ",0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,3,"   ",0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,
